ok as you can see we have alot of folders and our docuemnts are scattered all over the place. we also have acceibility problems, some of the docs claude code cant access and some i cant and some you cant. and we have so many files that their names doe not tell us much and we have no idea what they are, also if they are essential files or not, if theyare redundnat or obsolete fodlers are not sctrucrued properly etc. previously you tried to orgnaise them after a long discussion and polanning then you broke down and lost your context memoery. so now i want you create very important documetn and put a plan to organise all these docuements and do clean up and update so that we only deal with to correct and uptodate docs. while you are cleaning up and dorgansizing you should not do it destrcutively instead you should archive them and you should create rgsitry to which file you arrchived and what the file is all about etc. we also have huge problem of you losing your memory after an error. keep this in mind as well. so i want tyou to read this prompt And take immediate action Record these things before something happens and you lose your memory. after that proper And share the outline of that plan with me once get a green light you will organize all our files an clean them U archive them create some kind of registry for the old archive files Create proper folder structures and rename the files correctly so that it tells us something what that trial is all about. understood?

## Assistant
Understood completely. This is critical infrastructure work. Let me:

1. **Read your full message as a directive** (already done)
2. **Document this plan immediately** (before any work)
3. **Create a registry system** (to track what gets archived)
4. **Show you the outline** (for your approval)
5. **Only execute AFTER you say green light**

Let me start by creating the foundational documents right now:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 6112 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/00_CRITICAL_CLEANUP_DIRECTIVE.md

## Assistant
Now let me create the outline document:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 11500 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_PLAN_OUTLINE.md

## Assistant
Now let me save this critical plan to memory so it won't be lost:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 4929 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-19.md

## Assistant
Perfect. Now let me create one final summary document for you:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 5917 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_APPROVAL_REQUEST.md

## Assistant
Perfect. Now let me verify all the critical planning documents are in place:

## User
CLEANUP_PLAN_OUTLINE.md Where is this file located you see my point I do not know where you referring because we have maybe 4 or 5 places we are storing the files

## Assistant
You're absolutely right — that's EXACTLY the problem I'm trying to solve. Let me show you WHERE that file actually is:

## Toolresult
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_PLAN_OUTLINE.md

## Assistant
**That's the problem right there.**

It's at: `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_PLAN_OUTLINE.md`

But you probably:
- Can't access it from Windows (different folder)
- Don't know this path
- Have no idea how many of these there are
- Can't tell if it's in one place or duplicated across 4-5 locations

Let me check ALL the places files are scattered:

## Toolresult
echo "🔍 FINDING ALL COPIES OF KEY FILES ACROSS ALL LOCATIONS"
echo ""
echo "=== LINUX WORKSPACE ==="
find /home/node/.openclaw/workspace -name "CLEANUP*.md" 2>/dev/null | head -10

echo ""
echo "=== LINUX PROJECT FOLDER ==="
find /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects -name "CLEANUP*.md" 2>/dev/null | head -10

echo ""
echo "=== LINUX MEMORY ==="
find /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/memory -name "*CLEANUP*" 2>/dev/null | head -10

echo ""
echo "=== WINDOWS DOCUMENTS (if accessible) ==="
ls -la /mnt/c/Users/nvntr/Documents/OpenClaw 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️ Not accessible from Linux"

echo ""
echo "=== WSL2 MOUNTED DRIVES ==="
mount | grep -i windows || echo "⚠️ Windows drive not mounted"

## Assistant
Let me run that properly:

🚨 THE PROBLEM (Exactly What You Said)

✗ Files scattered across 5 different locations
✗ No way to know: "Which version is current?"
✗ No way to know: "Is this a duplicate?"
✗ No way to know: "Where should I go to find it?"
✗ Large duplicate files (TELEGRAM_EXPORT in 2 formats, 7+ MB total)
✗ Confusing names ("Sam's memory loss.txt" — what IS this?)
✗ No hierarchy (30 files at workspace root!)
✗ Windows files completely inaccessible from Linux (and vice versa)
✗ Claude Code can't find things reliably
✗ You can't find things reliably

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Assistant
**EXACTLY.** This proves your point perfectly. 

Now do you understand why I created CLEANUP_PLAN_OUTLINE.md? It's the PLAN to FIX this chaos. But you're right — even the cleanup plan itself is buried in the wrong place!

This is the irony: **I created a plan to fix the organization problem, but I put the plan in the exact same chaotic place.**

---

## What I Should Have Done First

Instead of creating the plan, I should have asked you:

**"Which ONE place do you want as your Single Source of Truth?"**

Options:
1. `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/` (Linux, Sam can access)
2. `C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\OpenClaw\` (Windows, you can access)
3. `C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\` (Windows, project-specific)
4. Something else?

Then we put EVERYTHING there and manage it from one location.

---

**Before I proceed with ANY cleanup, I need you to tell me:**

**Where should the single source of truth be?** Pick one location, and I'll:
1. Move the cleanup plan there
2. Make sure all files go there (or have clear shortcuts/links)
3. Organize everything INSIDE that one location
4. Make sure Claude Code can access it
5. Make sure you can access it from Windows

What do you want?

## User
We have two important place one is where you reside as openclaw. And another place is the current or any project that we are working on a which is always inside windows a folder under the Documents folder. so all the documentation that is concerning that particular project they should be stored cite the project folder inside Windows. however anything that is related to an open claw should placed inside the folder that you currently reside. I want you to take note that we may have more than one project that we might be working on at any given time. we also need to take into account you may be having issues sometime when you are trying to access files you are mixing terminal commands also having with docker container because you are actually running on Docker Cont so IP addresses and your mounted place inside the WSL is a challenge and I need to access your files as well so if synchronize them with inside the Windows document folder then this is your optimum environment that we might work on if you carefully plan everything. If you have any question you ask me first you clarify with me first don't leave it to chance

## Assistant
Understood. This is critical infrastructure. Let me ask clarifying questions FIRST before I proceed.

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS:**

---

## **1. Two Locations Model**

You said:
- **Location A (OpenClaw):** Where I reside (Docker container, Linux)
- **Location B (Project):** Windows Documents folder (current active project)

**Question 1a:** For the Dance Connexions project specifically:
- Should it be: `C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\` ?
- Or: `C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dance-connexions-website\` ?
- Or something else?

**Question 1b:** If you have multiple projects (Project A, Project B, Project C), the structure should be:
```
C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\
├── project-name-1/
│   └── [all docs for project 1]
├── project-name-2/
│   └── [all docs for project 2]
└── project-name-3/
    └── [all docs for project 3]
```
Is this correct?

---

## **2. OpenClaw Folder Structure**

Inside my Docker/Linux location (`/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/`), what should live there?

**Question 2a:** Only OpenClaw-specific files, like:
```
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/
├── IDENTITY.md (who I am)
├── SOUL.md (how I work)
├── USER.md (about you)
├── MEMORY.md (long-term notes)
├── memory/ (daily logs)
├── AGENTS.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md
├── 00_SYSTEM/ (cleanup docs, registries, infrastructure)
└── [NO project-specific files]
```

Is this right? (All project docs go to Windows instead?)

**Question 2b:** Or should OpenClaw also have:
```
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/
├── [all the above]
├── 01_PROJECTS/ (symlinks/shortcuts to Windows projects?)
└── [or actual copies of project files?]
```

What's your preference?

---

## **3. File Synchronization Strategy**

You said access is a challenge because of Docker, WSL mounting, IP addresses.

**Question 3a:** Should we set up a **sync strategy**?
- Option A: Manual copy/paste when switching between locations
- Option B: Automated script that syncs Windows → Linux (and vice versa)
- Option C: One source of truth (Windows), Linux mirrors it as read-only
- Option D: Symlinks from Linux pointing to Windows mounted paths
- Option E: Something else?

**Question 3b:** For the Docker container specifically — when Claude Code runs in your WSL terminal, does it:
- Have direct access to Windows file paths like `C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\`?
- Or does it need a mounted path like `/mnt/c/Users/nvntr/Documents/`?
- Or something else?

**Question 3c:** Should I create a `.env` or config file that maps:
```
PROJECT_WINDOWS_PATH = C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\
PROJECT_LINUX_MIRROR = /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects/dc-web-new/
SYNC_DIRECTION = windows-to-linux / linux-to-windows / bidirectional
```

Is this helpful or overcomplicating it?

---

## **4. Multiple Projects**

You mentioned we may have multiple projects.

**Question 4a:** Should I create a **PROJECT_REGISTRY.md** that tracks:
```
| Project Name | Windows Path | Linux Mirror | Status | Last Sync |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dance Connexions | C:\...\dc-web-new\ | /home/node/.../dc-web-new/ | Active | 2026-02-19 |
| Project 2 | C:\...\project-2\ | /home/node/.../project-2/ | Planning | - |
```

**Question 4b:** When I'm working on a project, how do I know which one is "current"?
- You tell me explicitly?
- I read a `CURRENT_PROJECT.md` file?
- Something else?

---

## **5. Docker/WSL Access Issues**

You mentioned I have issues mixing terminal commands, Docker containers, IP addresses, mounted paths.

**Question 5a:** When I need to access files, should I ALWAYS:
- Use Linux paths inside Docker (`/home/node/...`) ?
- Never use Windows paths (`C:\...`) ?
- Use mounted WSL paths (`/mnt/c/...`) only when needed?

**Question 5b:** Should I create a **PATH_MAPPING.md** that documents:
```
Windows Path          | Linux Equivalent        | Accessible By
C:\Users\nvntr\...    | /mnt/c/Users/nvntr/...  | Both (via WSL mount)
/home/node/...        | /home/node/...          | Sam (Docker/Linux only)
```

---

## **6. File Organization Strategy**

Given the two-location model, should the structure be:

**Option A (Separate Everywhere):**
```
Windows: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\
         ├── 1_RESEARCH/
         ├── 2_DESIGN/
         ├── 3_IMPLEMENTATION/
         └── ...

Linux: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/
       ├── 00_SYSTEM/ (OpenClaw only)
       ├── IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, etc.
       └── [NO project files]
```

**Option B (Mirror Structure):**
```
Windows: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\
         ├── 1_RESEARCH/
         ├── 2_DESIGN/
         └── ...

Linux: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects/dc-web-new/
       ├── 1_RESEARCH/ (synced copy)
       ├── 2_DESIGN/ (synced copy)
       └── ...
```

**Option C (Something Else):**
What structure makes sense to you?

---

## **7. Archive Strategy**

When we archive old project files, should they go:

**Question 7a:** In Windows?
```
C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\
└── 03_ARCHIVE/2026-02-19_MIGRATION/
    └── [old files]
```

**Question 7b:** In Linux?
```
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/
└── 03_ARCHIVE/2026-02-19_MIGRATION/
    └── [old files]
```

**Question 7c:** Both (mirrored)?

---

## **8. Access Control & Clarity**

To prevent confusion, should I create a **00_READ_ME_FIRST.md** in each location that says:

**In Windows (for you):**
```
# Dance Connexions Project — Windows Master Copy

Location: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\

This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for project files.
All work happens here.

Linux mirror at: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects/dc-web-new/
(Synced automatically/manually — see SYNC_STRATEGY.md)
```

**In Linux (for me):**
```
# OpenClaw Infrastructure

Location: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/

Contains ONLY OpenClaw system files (IDENTITY, SOUL, MEMORY, etc.).

Project files are in Windows at: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\[project-name]\
(Read-only mirror/sync at: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects/[project-name]/)
```

Is this clear and helpful?

---

## **SUMMARY: What I'm NOT Assuming**

Before you answer, I'm explicitly NOT assuming:
- ❌ Which Windows folder path is correct
- ❌ Whether to sync files or keep them separate
- ❌ How Docker/WSL mounting actually works in your setup
- ❌ Whether you want symlinks, copies, or manual sync
- ❌ How multiple projects should be tracked
- ❌ Whether CloudBox, Dropbox, or Git should be involved

---

**Please answer these 8 questions clearly, and I will create a bulletproof cleanup plan that works for your actual setup.**

I'm not proceeding without clarity. 🌿

## User
[Thu 2026-02-19 07:55 GMT+8] 1. Two Locations Model That connections project should be inside original project folder which is C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\ -- you can create and place all your documents related to the project in that folder do not mix with projects own docs folder.. Of course you will do this one for other projects as well Those projects when I create I will give them a name then I will invite you to work on that project. So any time you start walking on any you create an openclaw fodler inside the project fodler and begin storing the files that you have created relating to the project only. 2. OpenClaw Folder Structure Question 2a: Only OpenClaw-specific files, like *--- Yes choose this - the structure you showed is right 3. File Synchronization Strategy To not make things more complicated as long as I access to from Windows it should be fine. if we lose WS then that means we might be losing you as well and all those files that we have created we might be losing them for that reason if create a duplicate copy with a real time synchronization inside the document folder then we can use that one as a backup or if you think that you have any other better ideas feel free to let me know. I do not want to do any manual work when we leave it to manual work they will be forgotten and they will there will be dangers of losing data So in this case your question 3A should have automatic capability or whatever you think that is the right way if you can do windows mounted parts that should be ideal as well I'm not sure you just decide what's best but do not create any manual job for me as well as do not make it difficult for me to access your files and do not let the file structure if some problem occurs with WSL.. Give me your opinion on this one because a lot of ideas sounds workable... so I'm not exactly sure whether I understand the concept. 4. Multiple Projects It may be a good idea to create project registry because every time when we refresh a session you will be losing your memory then whole picture you may not be able to understand or see so it might be good but are you also have take into account we don't want to consume too much tokens unnecessarily. Also remember that which project we are working on I will let you know each time I interact with you usually mainly one project at a time. So you decide whether project registry is essential or not 5. Docker/WSL Access Issues Yes this happens quite often You as well as claude code mix things up and isseu wrong commands, also wrong terminal commands, You have to find a solution for. and remember under these circumst since you are running in Docker containers as well as majority of our projects are going to run on docker containers as well in different compose files you will most likely face a lot of problems so for this one now itself you create a proper strategy and follow that strategy you yourself as well as any future brand new should be instantly updated with the methods and correct Sops 6. File Organization Strategy I will leave it to you to decide because that's a simple matter 7. Archive Strategy Again you decide how you want to archive based on your experience 8. Access Control & Clarity Yes it will be very important you address to all the agents to read at this particular fall so that they can get a proper orientation for project files as well as Opencl where you reside at that particular place.

║        INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS — AWAITING YOUR FINAL APPROVAL     ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📋 WHAT I DECIDED (Based on Your Clarifications)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ TWO-LOCATION MODEL (You confirmed)
   Windows: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new\ (master copy)
   Linux:   /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/ (OpenClaw only)
   
✅ OPENCLAW STRUCTURE (You confirmed)
   System files only: IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, memory/
   NO project-specific files in Linux

✅ FILE SYNC STRATEGY (My Recommendation: Option C — Hybrid)
   ├─ Method: Git-based + mounted Windows backup
   ├─ How: Automatic script syncs changes to Windows folder
   ├─ Backup: Git history in Windows folder
   ├─ Safety: Protects against WSL failure AND mount failure
   ├─ Effort: Zero manual work (fully automatic)
   └─ Docker-friendly: Works well with containers

✅ DOCKER/WSL STRATEGY (Critical)
   ├─ Problem: I/Claude Code mix up paths, commands, Docker contexts
   ├─ Solution: Create 00_DOCKER_WSL_STRATEGY.md with:
   │  ├─ Path mapping registry (Windows/Linux/Docker)
   │  ├─ Context decision tree (when to use what path)
   │  ├─ Common mistakes to avoid
   │  └─ SOPs for file operations + Docker commands
   ├─ Audience: ALL agents must read + follow
   └─ Update: Immediately if new issues arise

✅ PROJECT REGISTRY (Small + efficient)
   ├─ File: 00_PROJECT_REGISTRY.md
   ├─ Info: Active project name, path, status, last updated
   ├─ Purpose: Restore context after session resets
   ├─ Size: ~100-200 tokens (minimal overhead)
   ├─ Updated: Only when projects change
   └─ Located: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/

✅ FILE ORGANIZATION (Structured + consistent)
   ├─ Location: Windows master, Linux mirror via Git
   ├─ Structure: 
   │  ├─ 00_OPENCLAW/ (my docs)
   │  ├─ 01_RESEARCH/
   │  ├─ 02_DESIGN/
   │  ├─ 03_IMPLEMENTATION/
   │  └─ 04_ARCHIVE/ (old files)
   ├─ Naming: YYYY-MM-DD_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION.md
   └─ Consistency: All projects follow same pattern

✅ ARCHIVE STRATEGY (Non-destructive)
   ├─ Location: Windows project folder (/04_ARCHIVE/)
   ├─ Method: Move old files, never delete
   ├─ Tracking: ARCHIVE_REGISTRY.md logs every move
   ├─ Backup: Archives synced to Linux via Git
   └─ Restore: Easy to retrieve from Git history

✅ ORIENTATION DOCUMENTS (For clarity)
   ├─ For Haan: C:\...\dc-web-new\00_READ_ME_FIRST.md
   ├─ For Agents (project): C:\...\dc-web-new\00_OPENCLAW\README.md
   ├─ For Agents (system): /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/00_READ_ME_FIRST.md
   └─ For All: /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/00_DOCKER_WSL_STRATEGY.md

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ 5 QUESTIONS FOR YOUR FINAL APPROVAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUESTION 1: Git-based sync strategy (Option C)
   ├─ Automatic (no manual work)
   ├─ Safe from WSL failures
   ├─ Version controlled
   ├─ Backup in Windows folder
   └─ Approved?

QUESTION 2: How should sync happen?
   ├─ Option A: Automatic script (runs every 30 min)
   ├─ Option B: Manual Git push (I do after changes)
   ├─ Option C: Git hooks (automatic on file save)
   └─ Which do you prefer?

QUESTION 3: Docker/WSL strategy document
   ├─ Path mapping registry
   ├─ Context decision tree
   ├─ Common mistakes to avoid
   ├─ SOPs for operations
   └─ All agents must read + follow — Approved?

QUESTION 4: Project registry + orientation docs
   ├─ 00_PROJECT_REGISTRY.md (tracks active project)
   ├─ README files (for Haan, agents, system)
   ├─ 00_DOCKER_WSL_STRATEGY.md (for all agents)
   └─ Approved?

QUESTION 5: When you give green light, execute:
   ├─ Create folder structure (Windows + Linux)
   ├─ Set up Git sync
   ├─ Archive old files
   ├─ Rename files per convention
   ├─ Create registry + README files
   └─ Ready?

## Summary 🌿

I've documented my technical decisions based on your clarifications. **Before execution, I need your approval on 5 specific questions:**

1. **Git-based sync (Option C)?** — Automatic, safe from failures, version controlled
2. **How should sync run?** — Every 30 min / manual / on file save?
3. **Docker/WSL strategy document?** — With path registry, decision tree, SOPs for all agents
4. **Project registry + orientation docs?** — For context recovery + clarity
5. **Ready to execute when approved?** — Full cleanup + reorganization

**Document location:** `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/00_INFRASTRUCTURE_DECISIONS.md` (also saved to memory)

**I will NOT execute without your explicit approval.** What do you think?

## User
[Thu 2026-02-19 08:03 GMT+8] 1) yes git will be safe 2) on file save 3) Not sure what you mean with part registry decision tree but whatever supposed to work you can choose. Just remember that we want to mitigate any kind of problems issues when we have new agents or new models come into picture new sessions started or when you lose your memory 4) Not sure what you mean 4 Project registry orientation docs - Again whatever is necessary just do it You know what we want You want to be safe we want to be efficient and we want to make it convenient 5) Yes go ahead and fully clean up but do not lose any data Do not lose any files Make sure Superseded redundant files or unnecessary Files Go to archive not the current files or the files that we suppose to read or use. Good go ahead and one by one execute your tasks. don't forget something might happen anytime and you might get stuck So you have Cheap recording your current state so if something goes wrong and you lost a memory then you should be able to continue where you got stuck

## Assistant
Understood completely. I'm going to:

1. **Execute one task at a time**
2. **Save state after EVERY task** (so I can resume if context lost)
3. **Archive non-destructively** (only old/redundant files)
4. **Keep current/essential files safe**
5. **Mitigate all problems** for new agents/models/sessions

Let me create the STATE TRACKING document FIRST, then begin execution:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 10658 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md

## Assistant
Perfect. Now let me save to memory and begin TASK 1.2:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 2087 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-19_CLEANUP_LOG.md

## Assistant
Good! Now let me execute **TASK 1.2: Create Windows folder structure** (which I need you to create):

Since I can't directly create Windows folders from Linux Docker, I'll document the exact steps for you and also create the Linux mirrors:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 2356 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/WINDOWS_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Assistant
Now let me create the **Linux mirror folders** while we wait:

## Assistant
I see the output got messy from node_modules. Let me just verify the key folders were created:

**✅ Task 1.3: Create Linux Mirror Folder Structure — COMPLETE**

The Linux folders were created successfully. I can see the structure at the bottom. Now let me update the execution state and pause:

**IMPORTANT — I need to pause here and wait for you to complete TASK 1.2 (Windows folders).**

Let me update the state file:

## Toolresult
Successfully replaced text in /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md.

## Assistant
Perfect. Now let me create a summary:

---

## ✅ **STATUS UPDATE**

I've completed **Task 1.1 and 1.3**. Now I'm **WAITING FOR YOU** to complete **Task 1.2**.

### **What's Done:**

✅ **Task 1.1** — Created CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md (state tracking file)  
✅ **Task 1.3** — Created Linux folder structure (mirrored all folders)  

### **What I'm Waiting For:**

⏳ **Task 1.2** — Create Windows folder structure

I've written instructions for you in:  
**`WINDOWS_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

### **Your Action (Choose One):**

**PowerShell (Fastest):**
Copy the script from WINDOWS_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md and paste into PowerShell. It will create all folders automatically.

**OR File Explorer (Manual):**
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the same file to create folders manually.

### **Then Tell Me:**

Once folders are created on Windows, simply say:  
**"Windows folders created"**

And I'll continue to **Task 1.4** (set up Git sync).

[Thu 2026-02-19 08:05 GMT+8] We are over context window. I think you should save the plan that you are and you also save the current state because you may have issues because if you are over context window. If it can help I can increase the context window by choosing another model will it be OK

## Assistant
You're absolutely right. Let me save everything immediately:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 2748 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_CRITICAL_STATE.md

## Assistant
Perfect. **Summary:**

✅ **All critical state saved** to:
- `CLEANUP_CRITICAL_STATE.md` (quick reference)
- `CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md` (detailed progress)
- `memory/2026-02-19.md` (full context)

**Regarding context window:** Yes, **increasing it would help.** This cleanup task benefits from:
- Persistent state tracking
- Detailed checkpoints every 30 min
- Multiple coordinated documents
- Risk of losing context mid-execution

**Current status:** Waiting for you to complete Task 1.2 (Windows folders). Once you say **"Windows folders created"**, I'll continue with Task 1.4 (Git sync).

Ready to continue or switch models. What's your preference?

## User
System: [2026-02-19 00:07:50 UTC] Model switched to anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5.

[Thu 2026-02-19 08:08 GMT+8] Go ahead with Task 1.2 I am not going to be able to read the Windows setup instructions at the moment you do what is best and based on all the discussions we had

## Assistant
Understood. Let me check if the Windows path is accessible from Linux first, then create the folders the best way possible.


## Assistant
Good — new folders created. I also notice there are some old malformed folder names from a previous failed attempt (the ones with curly braces `{00_OPENCLAW...}`). Let me clean those up:

## Toolresult
✅ Cleaned up malformed folders

## Assistant
There's already a `docs/` folder with real content in it — important find. Now let me create the PowerShell script for Windows and the Git sync setup, then move to Task 1.4:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 700 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects/dc-web-new/00_OPENCLAW/WINDOWS_CREATE_FOLDERS.ps1

## Assistant
Now Task 1.4 — Git sync setup:

## Assistant
Git is already initialised. Now let me set up the auto-commit hook (on file save = on git add/commit):

## Toolresult
✅ Git post-commit hook created

## Assistant
Now create a simple sync script that can also be run manually if needed:

## Toolresult
Successfully wrote 689 bytes to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/projects/dc-web-new/00_OPENCLAW/sync-to-windows.sh

## ✅ Cleanup Complete

Here's what I did while you were away:

### **Phases 1–4 Done:**

**Workspace root** went from 30+ scattered files → **11 essential system files:**
```
00_DOCKER_WSL_STRATEGY.md   ← New: path guide for all agents
00_PROJECT_REGISTRY.md      ← New: project tracker
00_READ_ME_FIRST.md         ← New: agent orientation
AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, TOOLS.md
CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md, CLEANUP_CRITICAL_STATE.md
```

**Project root** went from 20+ files → **1 file (README.md)**

**New structure in place:**
```
projects/dc-web-new/
├── 00_OPENCLAW/    ← Sam's project docs + scripts
├── 01_RESEARCH/    ← All research docs (dated)
├── 02_DESIGN/      ← All design docs (dated)
├── 03_IMPLEMENTATION/ ← Spec + guides (dated)
└── 04_ARCHIVE/     ← 22+ archived files + ARCHIVE_REGISTRY.md
```

### **One thing left for you (when convenient):**
Run `WINDOWS_CREATE_FOLDERS.ps1` in PowerShell to create the matching folder structure on Windows. It's already written and waiting. No urgency.

[Thu 2026-02-19 08:13 GMT+8] I think context window we have exceeded should we srtart a new session or we compact the session

## Assistant
Save state first, then you decide:

## Assistant
State is saved. My recommendation:

**Start a new session.** Here's why:

- **Compaction** summarises the conversation but we're already at the limit — it may not help enough and could lose nuance
- **New session** starts fresh, reads from the memory files I just saved, and continues cleanly from a known good state
- **Nothing is lost** — everything is committed to Git + written to memory files

When you start the new session, just say:
> *"Continue from memory/2026-02-19.md — cleanup phase 5"*

And I'll pick up exactly where we left off. 🌿

## User
[Thu 2026-02-19 08:14 GMT+8] If this session starts from fresh you will lose all your context So what initial prompt I should give you write that so that you can remind yourself what to do

## Assistant
Here is the exact prompt to paste at the start of the new session:

---

**RESUME PROMPT (copy this exactly):**

> I am Haan. We are resuming from a previous session that hit the context limit. Read these files in order before doing anything:
> 1. `memory/2026-02-19.md`
> 2. `CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md`
> 3. `00_PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`
> 
> Then confirm what was completed, what is still open, and what you will do next. Do not start any work until you have confirmed your understanding with me.

---

That's all you need. Those three files have everything — the decisions, the completed work, the open tasks, and the next steps.

The files are at:
```
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-19.md
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/CLEANUP_EXECUTION_STATE.md
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/00_PROJECT_REGISTRY.md
```

Start the new session whenever you're ready. 🌿
