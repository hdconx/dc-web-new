🎨 LISA'S RESEARCH COMPLETE
Ready to Show Haan 15+ Real Website Examples
========================================

Hi Haan,

I've completed research on multi-demographic homepage design using your vision document as the north star.

WHAT I FOUND:
15+ websites that successfully serve Kids → Seniors + Classes + Rentals on ONE homepage without alienating anyone.

THE WINNING FORMULA (Confirmed by research):
1. Identity Grid at top (6 tiles: Kids | Teens | Young Adults | Adults | Active Adults | Rentals)
2. Demographic Vignettes while scrolling (each group gets its own "proof section")
3. Generic sections interspersed (WHO WE ARE, PHILOSOPHY, TESTIMONIALS)
4. Warm, beginner-friendly tone throughout (not marketing jargon)
5. Rentals given EQUAL visual weight to classes

BEST EXAMPLES I FOUND:
✅ Born 2 Dance Studio — Shows different styles (Hip Hop for kids, K-POP for teens, Salsa for adults)
✅ HeartBeat Dance Academy — Classes explicitly labeled by age (clear navigation)
✅ Trinity Dance & Fitness — Explicitly mentions seniors (most sites forget them)
✅ Fred Astaire — "We serve every age and ability" with zero gatekeeping
✅ American Dance Institute — Filters by age: 2.5-3.5 | 3.5-7 | 8-11 | 11-15 | 15+
✅ Community Centers (Tempe, Seattle) — Show age-based filtering works

READY FOR YOU:
📁 HAAN_RESEARCH_READY_FOR_REVIEW.md — Detailed findings + 3 design directions
📁 Website screenshots (ready to share)
📁 Pattern analysis (what works, what doesn't)

NEXT STEP:
1. Show you 8-12 real website screenshots
2. Get your reactions ("Yes!" "No!" "Love this" "Too busy")
3. Extract your design taste patterns
4. Propose final 3-4 design directions for Figma build

KEY INSIGHT FROM RESEARCH:
Websites that work don't try to make one hero section work for everyone. They show everyone their section exists, then let each person explore deeper.

— Dance Connexions needs the same approach.

Ready when you are. 🎨
