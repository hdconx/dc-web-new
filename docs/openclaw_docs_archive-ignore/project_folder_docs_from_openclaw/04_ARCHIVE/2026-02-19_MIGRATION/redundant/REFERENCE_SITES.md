_For: Haan's Design Direction Research_

## HOW TO USE THIS

Visit each site. Spend 2 minutes scanning.

**What to look for:**
- How is the middle section organized?
- Do you like the dark theme approach?
- How are photos used (full-bleed? grids? none?)
- Is there lots of copy or minimal?
- How do they handle "proof of credibility"?
- What's the feeling? (premium, fun, community, professional?)

**Screenshot:** Take a screenshot of sections you like. Send them to me with "I like this vibe."

## WHAT TO DO WITH WHAT YOU FIND

1. **Screenshot sections you like**
   - Dark theme examples
   - Section layouts
   - Typography sizes
   - Spacing/whitespace

2. **Send to me with:**
   ```
   "I like this because: [reason]"
   "From this site: [URL]"
   "Specifically this section: [description or screenshot]"
   ```

3. **Collect 5–10 favorites**
   Then we can see patterns in what appeals to you

4. **Make a mood board** (optional)
   - Figma, Miro, or Pinterest
   - Collect screenshots
   - Share with me
   - Fast visual feedback

---

## ACTUAL HOMEWORK (If You're Serious)

**Spend 1 hour:**

1. Visit 5 sites from this list (20 min)
2. Screenshot 1 section you like from each (10 min)
3. Look at Dribbble "dance studio" search (15 min)
4. Look at Framer fitness templates (10 min)
5. Send me 3 screenshots + "I like this because..."

**That's it.** This gives me real insight into your taste.

---

## NO TIME? HERE'S THE SHORTCUT

Just tell me:

**"Which of these feels right?"**

- A) **Ailey + BABEL** (premium, professional, dark, minimal)
- B) **CHi Fitness + wellness templates** (warm, community, approachable)
- C) **Framer templates + energetic vibes** (bold, young, movement-focused)
- D) **Luxury hotel websites** (minimal, exclusive, high-end)

Even just picking A/B/C/D tells me which direction to focus on.

---

## COMMON TRAPS TO AVOID

❌ **Don't pick based on "it looks cool"**
- Pick based on "does this match my studio's vibe?"

❌ **Don't try to combine all the things you like**
- Commit to ONE direction
- One voice = strong brand

❌ **Don't assume you need real photos**
- AI images work fine on dark backgrounds
- You don't need professional photography

❌ **Don't over-engineer the first version**
- Simple > complex
- You can add animations later
- Get the structure right first

---

## NEXT STEP

1. **Browse 2–3 sites** from this list
2. **Tell me what you like** (one sentence is enough)
3. **We lock in a direction**
4. **You start building**

That's it. No paralysis by analysis.
