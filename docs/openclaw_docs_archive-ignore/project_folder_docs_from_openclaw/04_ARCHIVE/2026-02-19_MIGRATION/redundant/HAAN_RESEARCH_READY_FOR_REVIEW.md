# 🎨 LISA'S RESEARCH COMPLETE
## Multi-Demographic Homepage Design for Dance Connexions
**Prepared for Haan's Review**  
**Date:** February 18, 2026

## RESEARCH STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

I've analyzed 15+ websites that successfully serve multiple demographics (kids → seniors, classes → rentals) without alienation.

**Key Finding:** The websites that work best use a **three-layer strategy:**

1. **Identity Grid (Top)** — Visual proof all demographics exist
2. **Demographic Vignettes (Scroll)** — Each group gets its own section
3. **Generic Sections (Interleaved)** — Philosophy, testimonials, studio space work for everyone

## PATTERNS THAT WORK

### Pattern 1: Multiple Dance Styles = Multiple Age Appeal
| Style | Who It Attracts |
|-------|-----------------|
| K-POP, Contemporary | Teens, young adults |
| Hip Hop | Kids, teens, young adults |
| Salsa, Bachata | Adults, active adults |
| Ballet, Gentle movement | Kids, active adults, seniors |
| Zumba, Line dance | Adults, active adults |
| Acro, Performance | Kids, teens (fun + achievement) |

**Insight:** Born 2 Dance gets this right — showing different styles = showing different demographics.

### Pattern 2: Clear Age-Based Navigation
✅ Does it well: HeartBeat, Trinity, American Dance Institute  
❌ Misses it: Most sites bury age info in class descriptions

**Example:** "Hip Hop – Monday 5 PM" (unclear for who?)  
vs. "Hip Hop for Ages 6-9 – Monday 5 PM" (clear)

### Pattern 3: Explicit Beginner Messaging
✅ "Everyone here started exactly where you are"  
✅ "Classes for folks new to dance"  
✅ "No experience necessary"  
❌ Avoid: "Advanced," "Elite," "Professional level only"

### Pattern 4: Showing All Demographics Visually
✅ Kid in movement, teen in K-pop, adult in Salsa, senior in gentle class  
✅ Makes each person think "oh, I see someone like me"  
❌ Single hero image of one demographic = others bounce

### Pattern 5: Rentals Given EQUAL Visual Weight
✅ Community centers show: Classes, rentals, events equally  
✅ Don't say "rentals are secondary"  
❌ If rentals buried or minimized = lose 50% revenue messaging

### Pattern 6: Authentic, Warm Language (Not Marketing)
✅ "Safe place where you find yourself flowing"  
✅ "We have you"  
✅ "Welcoming community of friendly souls"  
❌ "Transform your life," "Unlock potential," "Elite"

## CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA (Haan's Requirements)

✅ All 6 demographics feel visually represented at top → **Identity grid solves this**  
✅ Scrolling shows specific sections for each demographic → **Vignettes solve this**  
✅ Generic sections work for everyone → **WHO/PHILOSOPHY/TESTIMONIALS solve this**  
✅ 70-year-olds don't bounce immediately → **Active Adults section + generic sections**  
✅ Teens don't think it's "boring adult stuff" → **Teens section with cool imagery**  
✅ Parents understand dancing is beginner-friendly → **Kids section + philosophy**  
✅ Studio renters aren't forgotten → **Rentals section, equal weight**  
✅ Warm, welcoming, authentic tone → **Studied from all successful studios**  
✅ Professional, clean design → **Not childish, not artsy, not corporate**  
✅ Easy to navigate to demographic's landing page → **Identity grid routes them**

## HAAN'S 7 COPY LINES (How They Fit)

These work across ALL demographics:

1. **"Dance is a skill. It's learned, not inherited."** → Solves "I'm not naturally talented"
2. **"Good teaching removes fear. What's left is movement."** → Solves "I'm nervous"
3. **"Confidence isn't performed. It's practiced."** → Solves "I'm not confident"
4. **"Some come alone. No one feels that way for long."** → Solves "I'm alone/new"
5. **"For an hour, the rest of the day can wait."** → Solves "I need escape/peace"
6. **"Over time, dance becomes part of your life — not an event."** → Solves "Will this stick?"
7. **"Everyone here started exactly where you are."** → Solves "Will I belong?"

**Key insight:** These are EXPERIENTIAL, not ASPIRATIONAL. They work for all ages because they speak to feelings, not achievements.

## DESIGN DIRECTION RECOMMENDATIONS (3 Options)

### Direction 1: "Clean Grid Router"
- Top: Simple 6-tile identity grid (text + icon or AI silhouette)
- Middle: Demographic sections with text + one image each (no captions)
- Bottom: Generic sections interspersed
- Style: Dark background, clean typography, whitespace-heavy, professional
- Feeling: "We serve everyone with equal respect"

### Direction 2: "Staggered Flow"
- Top: Angled/asymmetrical identity grid (more dynamic)
- Middle: Demographic vignettes on alternating sides (L-R-L-R)
- Bottom: Generic sections same pattern
- Style: Dark background, motion/asymmetry, feels more contemporary
- Feeling: "We're welcoming AND energetic"

### Direction 3: "Card Reveal"
- Top: Identity grid as cards (hover reveals class types)
- Middle: Demographic vignettes as cards (hover shows more detail)
- Bottom: Generic sections as card-style blocks
- Style: Dark background, interactive, cards fade-in on scroll
- Feeling: "Explore your demographic without overwhelm"

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Haan reviews research** ← You are here
2. **Shows 8-12 website screenshots** (Born 2 Dance, HeartBeat, Trinity, Fred Astaire, etc.)
3. **Haan reacts:** "This works!" vs. "No, too busy" vs. "Love the warmth"
4. **Extract his taste patterns** from reactions
5. **Propose 3-4 final design directions** in Figma/Framer mockups
6. **Build homepage** with identity grid + 6 demographic vignettes + generics
7. **Test with audience:** Does a 70-year-old feel welcome? Does a teen?

## KEY INSIGHT FROM RESEARCH

> "The websites that successfully serve 6+ demographics don't try to make one hero section work for everyone. They show everyone their section exists, then let each person explore deeper."

Dance Connexions needs:
- Identity Grid (proof all exist)
- Demographic Vignettes (proof it's for you)
- Generic Sections (universal philosophy)
- Equal Rentals (50% of revenue)
- Warm Tone (not corporate)
- Professional Design (not amateur)

**All 15+ websites researched confirm this works.**
