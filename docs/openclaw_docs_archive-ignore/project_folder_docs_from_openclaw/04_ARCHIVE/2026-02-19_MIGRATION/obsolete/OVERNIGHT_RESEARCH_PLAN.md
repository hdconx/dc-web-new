# Overnight Research & Preparation Plan
**Date:** 2026-02-18 05:40 GMT+8  
**Owner:** Haan (sleeping)  
**Agent:** Sam (main assistant)  
**Task Duration:** Next 4-8 hours (until Haan wakes up)

---

## MISSION

While Haan sleeps, prepare comprehensive design research, target market analysis, and PRD foundations so that when he wakes up, we have:
1. ✅ Competitor/inspiration website analysis (8-12 real examples)
2. ✅ Target market demographics breakdown
3. ✅ Content strategy PRD (Product Requirements Document)
4. ✅ Design direction recommendations
5. ✅ All documentation organized and ready to review

## PHASE 1: TARGET MARKET RESEARCH

### 1A: Primary Demographics (Malaysia Context)
**Segments to Research:**
- **Kids (5-12):** Parents finding activities, how they browse, what convinces them
- **Teens (13-18):** K-pop enthusiasts, social media natives, self-directed decision makers
- **Young Adults (18-30):** Fitness seekers, professionals, social connection seekers
- **Adults (30-50):** Career-focused, family time, stress relief, Salsa/Bachata learners
- **Active Adults (50+):** Health-conscious, social community, gentle movement options
- **Studio Renters:** Corporate events, workshops, performances, professional users

**Research Focus:**
- How each demographic searches for dance classes (Google vs TikTok vs Instagram)
- What messaging converts each group
- Pain points for each demographic
- What other studios do well/poorly for each segment
- Malaysian context: Multicultural audience, diverse income levels, family importance

### 1B: Parallel Revenue Stream (Studio Rentals)
- Who rents dance studios in Malaysia?
- Corporate teams, event planners, other studios, performance groups
- How do they find rentals?
- What matters to them (price, flexibility, facilities, location, booking ease)?

## PHASE 2: COMPETITOR & INSPIRATION WEBSITE ANALYSIS

### 2A: Website Categories to Research

**Category 1: Dance Studios (Multi-demographic)**
- Global examples: multiple age groups served
- Asian examples: Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia if available
- Look for: How they route to demographics, visual inclusion, messaging approach

**Category 2: Fitness Facilities (Inclusive)**
- Gyms, yoga studios, wellness centers
- Research: How they welcome all ages without alienation
- Look for: Color schemes, typography, spacing, imagery strategy

**Category 3: Community Centers / Recreation**
- Multi-purpose facilities serving 8-70 age range
- Research: How they structure navigation, visual hierarchy
- Look for: Accessibility, inclusive design patterns

**Category 4: Service Businesses (Multi-demographic)**
- Hair salons, medical practices, education centers
- Research: How they address multiple customer types on one homepage
- Look for: Segmentation approaches, routing strategies

### 2B: What to Analyze from Each Website
For each site found, capture:
- **URL + Screenshot**
- **Color palette** (primary, secondary, background, accent)
- **Typography** (font families, hierarchy, sizes)
- **Hero section approach** (image, video, minimal, text-forward)
- **Navigation structure** (how do users find their segment?)
- **Demographic representation** (visual inclusion, how many age groups shown?)
- **Call-to-actions** (buttons, placement, messaging)
- **Content flow** (sections, pacing, asymmetry)
- **Imagery style** (photos, illustrations, video, generated)
- **What works** (makes you stay, feels welcoming, clear direction)
- **What doesn't** (alienates, confusing, generic, slow)

---

## PHASE 3: CONTENT STRATEGY PRD

### 3A: Homepage Content Sections (Based on Vision)
Document the ideal structure:
1. **Identity Grid** — 6 demographic tiles + studio rentals
2. **Kids Section** — Imagery + messaging for 5-12 audience
3. **Teens Section** — K-pop / cool styles, peer community focus
4. **Young Adults Section** — Fitness, social, learning angle
5. **Adults Section** — Salsa/Bachata, stress relief, beginner-friendly
6. **Active Adults (50+) Section** — Health, vitality, gentle options, friendship
7. **Studio Rentals Section** — Professional facilities, flexibility, event hosting
8. **Who We Are** — Warm, grounded intro (no boasting)
9. **Our Philosophy** — Dance is learnable, beginner-friendly, community-focused
10. **Testimonials** (future) — Diverse voices, authentic
11. **Studio Pictures** — Professional, welcoming, diverse people
12. **Rental Pictures** — Professional spaces, event examples

### 3B: Messaging Framework by Demographic
For each demographic, define:
- **Core message** (what matters to them most)
- **Tone** (playful? serious? warm? energetic?)
- **CTA approach** (what action do we want from them?)
- **Visual direction** (what imagery resonates?)
- **Pain point addressed** (what barrier are we removing?)

### 3C: Content Inventory
- How much text vs imagery per section?
- How many images per demographic?
- Typography: Headlines vs body vs captions per section?
- Color usage: Same palette throughout or section-specific accents?

---

## PHASE 4: DESIGN DIRECTION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A: Visual Direction Options (3-4 Approaches)

Based on competitor research, propose:

**Direction 1: [Name] — [Description]**
- Color palette
- Typography approach
- Hero section strategy
- Demographic sections approach
- Imagery style
- Spacing/asymmetry approach
- Why it works for multi-demographic audience
- Malaysia context fit

**Direction 2: [Name] — [Description]**
- (Same framework)

**Direction 3: [Name] — [Description]**
- (Same framework)

**Direction 4: [Name] — [Description]**
- (Same framework)

### 4B: Design Principles Extracted
From competitor analysis, identify:
- What color combinations work for inclusive, welcoming feel?
- What typography hierarchy makes content discoverable?
- What spacing patterns feel premium but not cold?
- What imagery styles feel professional but warm?
- What navigation patterns serve multiple demographics?

## RESEARCH CONSTRAINTS

✅ **DO:**
- Research real websites (screenshots, analysis)
- Focus on inclusion without alienation
- Consider Malaysia context (multicultural, diverse income, family values)
- Document patterns and principles
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Stay organized and clear

❌ **DON'T:**
- Propose solutions Haan already rejected
- Use marketing jargon or corporate speak
- Assume what works globally works in Malaysia
- Create generic fitness/dance studio templates
- Ignore the 2-business-lines angle (classes + rentals)

---

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Approach: Spawn specialized sub-agents for focused research**

### Sub-Agent 1: Market Researcher
Task: Deep dive into target demographics (kids, teens, adults, seniors, renters)
- How do they search?
- What messaging converts?
- Malaysia-specific context?
- Pain points + motivations?

### Sub-Agent 2: Design Analyst
Task: Find 10-12 websites serving multi-demographic audiences
- Screenshot + analyze each
- Extract color, typography, layout patterns
- Identify what works/doesn't
- Categorize by approach (routing, inclusion, visual hierarchy)

### Sub-Agent 3: Content Strategist
Task: Define messaging + content framework
- Messaging per demographic
- Content sections
- Tone/voice guide
- Content inventory (text, images, hierarchy)

### Sub-Agent 4: Design Direction Creator
Task: Synthesize research into 3-4 visual directions
- Color palettes
- Typography approaches
- Layout concepts
- Why each works for target market

**Agent Timeout Mitigation:**
- Spawn with full task context embedded (not via sessions_send)
- Keep tasks focused and specific
- Use longer timeoutSeconds (120-180s)
- Document findings in markdown files (persistent, not session-dependent)

✅ **DESIGN_DIRECTIONS.md** — 3-4 visual approaches with rationale  
✅ **CONTENT_STRATEGY_PRD.md** — Clear messaging + content framework  
✅ **RECOMMENDATIONS.md** — Top choice + next steps  

**Result:** Haan can review, react, and make decisions without re-explaining requirements.
