🎨 EMOTIONAL TEMPERATURE FOR CONTENT SECTION
Dance Connexions Website Redesign
========================================

QUESTION FOR HAAN:
How should the content section (Quick Choice Bar → Final CTA) feel?

----------------------------------------
OPTION A: INSPIRATIONAL ✨
----------------------------------------
What it is:
- Aspirational, elite energy
- "You could be like them"
- World-class, polished, premium
- Transformation through excellence

Best examples found:
✓ Equinox (equinox.com)
✓ CLI Studios (clistudios.com) — "global leader"
✓ SLT NYC (sltnyc.com) — prestige

Copy flavor:
- "Unlock your highest performance"
- "World-renowned instructors"
- "Transform your body and mind"
- Empower through aspiration

Visual feel:
- Polished, clean, intimidating at times
- Show the best, the elite, the peak
- Photography: peak performance moments
- Sometimes feels exclusive (in a good way)

----------------------------------------
OPTION B: EXPERIENTIAL 🎭
----------------------------------------
What it is:
- Immersive, warm, accessible
- "What this feels like right now"
- Come-as-you-are, belonging first
- Connection through immediacy

Best examples found:
✓ Arthur Murray (arthurmurray.com) — "dancing in 5 minutes"
✓ Rumble Boxing (rumbleboxinggym.com) — authentic, raw
✓ Centre Stage Dance Academy (dancecsda.com) — inclusive

Copy flavor:
- "You'll be dancing in 5 minutes"
- "Some come alone. No one feels that way for long."
- "For an hour, the rest of the day can wait"
- Embrace through belonging

Visual feel:
- Warm, relatable, immediate
- Show the journey, not just the peak
- Photography: mid-movement, feeling, expression
- Feels welcoming to everyone

----------------------------------------
HAAN'S 7 COPY LINES ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

They lean EXPERIENTIAL:
1. "Dance is a skill. It's learned, not inherited." → Demystify (not "elite")
2. "Good teaching removes fear. What's left is movement." → Relief, discovery
3. "Confidence isn't performed. It's practiced." → Journey, not product
4. "Some come alone. No one feels that way for long." → PURE belonging
5. "For an hour, the rest of the day can wait." → Escape, peace
6. "Over time, dance becomes part of your life — not an event." → Integration
7. "Everyone here started exactly where you are." → PURE inclusivity

These are NOT about "elite training" or "world-class instruction"
These ARE about feeling, transformation over time, and belonging

RECOMMENDATION: Confirm EXPERIENTIAL direction

----------------------------------------
KEY INSIGHT
----------------------------------------

Both can feel PREMIUM.
Both can use dark backgrounds + whitespace.

The difference is:
- INSPIRATIONAL: "Be like the best"
- EXPERIENTIAL: "Discover what you're capable of"

Dance Connexions is clearly EXPERIENTIAL.
