## What Works

1. **Boldly Inclusive Opening:** "Everybody can dance" removes barriers immediately
2. **No apologies:** Doesn't say "Even if you can't dance," says "There's no requirement"
3. **Cultural specificity:** Chinese dance heritage adds credibility and unique positioning
4. **Family metaphor:** "Everyone is viewed as family" creates belonging feeling
5. **Diverse instructor profiles:** Shows the studio practices what it preaches
6. **Multiple entry points:** Search by style, then find your level
7. **Performance opportunities:** Shows this isn't just exercise; it's art
8. **Bilingual content:** Chinese language section signals welcome to Asian communities
9. **Accessible pricing:** Not mentioned but implied (no "premium only" language)

---

## What Doesn't Work

1. **Schedule accessibility:** (Inferred) May require clicking multiple sections to find class times
2. **Visual outdatedness:** Website design appears older (could impact modern user perception)
3. **Mobile optimization:** (Unclear from text) May not be responsive
4. **Professional photography:** Classes shown via images, but these may not be high-quality
5. **Limited hero engagement:** Text-only hero might not stop scroll on modern sites
6. **Pricing transparency:** No visible pricing information
7. **Free trial offer:** Not explicitly mentioned (risk barrier)

## Design Innovations

### 1. **"Everyone is Family" Positioning**
This is powerfully inclusive. Instead of "Join our community," it says "We are family already."

### 2. **Intersection of Age + Style**
By listing styles first, then noting each is for all ages, it avoids age-gating content.

### 3. **Cultural Anchor**
The 5,000-year history of Chinese dance gives legitimacy and cultural pride, appealing to multiple demographics.

### 4. **Performance as Inclusion**
Offering performance opportunities shows this isn't just "fitness," it's art-making. Everyone can be an artist.
