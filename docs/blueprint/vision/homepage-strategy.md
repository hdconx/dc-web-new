## Core Insight

This is NOT a marketing homepage. This is a **smart demographic router + inclusive welcome** that:
1. Routes visitors to their demographic landing page
2. Makes ALL demographics feel welcome on the main page
3. Prevents alienation (e.g., 70-year-olds shouldn't see K-pop dancers at top)
4. Convinces each demographic to explore deeper by showing their own section exists

**Key Principle:** "This school has classes for people like me."

## Homepage Structure

### Top Section: Identity Grid (Demographic Router)
**6 tiles representing each demographic:**
- Kids
- Teens
- Young Adults
- Adults
- Active Adults (50+)
- Studio Rentals

**Purpose:** Clear, visual routing to demographic-specific pages
**Why it works:** Visitors immediately see if their age group is represented

### Middle Sections: Demographic Vignettes
Each demographic gets its own section as user scrolls down:

**KIDS Section**
- Imagery: Kids learning, having fun, moving freely
- Messaging: Beginner-friendly, coolness, making friends
- Tone: Approachable, playful but not cartoonish

**TEENS Section**
- Imagery: Teens in K-pop, contemporary, cool moves
- Messaging: Coolness, creativity, peer community, self-expression
- Tone: Confident, modern, aspirational

**YOUNG ADULTS Section**
- Imagery: Young adults learning, socializing, fitness-focused
- Messaging: Social connection, fitness, learning new skills
- Tone: Energetic, inclusive, growth-oriented

**ADULTS Section**
- Imagery: Adults in salsa, bachata, contemporary, learning
- Messaging: Never too late to learn, social connection, fitness, stress relief
- Tone: Welcoming, empowering, supportive

**ACTIVE ADULTS (50+) Section**

- Messaging: Health, vitality, friendship, gentle movement options
- Tone: Respectful, energetic, inclusive

**STUDIO RENTALS Section**
- Imagery: Studio spaces, professional setup, events, classes in session
- Messaging: Flexible rental, professional facilities, community events
- Tone: Professional, practical, accessible

### Generic Sections: Universal Welcome

**WHO WE ARE**

- Warm, grounded introduction to the space
- NO "since 1999" credentials or flowery language
- Focus on: We're here to teach dance to everyone

**OUR PHILOSOPHY / THINKING ABOUT DANCE**
- Dance is learnable (not an inborn talent)
- Beginner-friendly environment
- Community over competition
- Dance brings confidence, friendship, health, joy
- NO marketing jargon

## Critical Design Principles

### 1. Inclusion Without Alienation
- Top hero area must represent ALL demographics visually
- Identity grid tiles provide "proof" their demographic exists
- Demographic vignettes as they scroll provide "proof" it's for them

### 2. Beginner-Friendly Messaging
- Emphasize: "Dance is learned, not inherited"
- Emphasize: "Everyone here started exactly where you are"
- Avoid: Elite language, intimidation, "advanced dancers"

### 3. What Matters to Each Demographic
- **Kids:** Coolness, fun, making friends, expressing themselves
- **Teens:** Cool dance styles (K-pop, etc.), peer community, creativity
- **Young Adults:** Fitness, social connection, learning new skills, fun
- **Adults:** Salsa/Bachata options, fitness, stress relief, beginner-friendly
- **Active Adults (50+):** Health, vitality, gentle options, friendship, community
- **Studio Renters:** Professional facilities, flexibility, variety of uses

### 4. Two Business Lines
- Classes (~50% revenue) — routed through demographic pages
- Studio Rentals (~50% revenue) — routed through rental section
- Both equally important; must not prioritize one over the other

### 5. Language & Tone
- **NO marketing jargon** ("Transform your life," "Unlock potential," etc.)
- **USE:** Warm, grounded, authentic language
- **AVOID:** Corporate, sales-y, overpromising
- **REFLECT:** Malaysian multicultural values (community, belonging, family)

### 6. Visual Consistency
- Dark premium aesthetic (black/zinc-950 backgrounds)
- AI-generated imagery only (no real student/staff photos for privacy)
- Asymmetrical spacing (feels discovered, not listed)
- Professional, clean, welcoming
- NOT: childish, overly artistic, cartoonish, feminine-coded, generic
