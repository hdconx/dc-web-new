# Technical Specification: Dance Connexions Website Development

This document provides comprehensive research findings and actionable specifications for developing the Dance Connexions website. It is designed to be used as a primary context for **Claude Code** to generate high-quality, demographic-targeted landing pages and a routing home page.

---

## 1. AI-Generated Imagery Strategy

Since real student photos are unavailable due to privacy reasons, the Dance Connexions website will rely entirely on AI-generated imagery. The objective is to cultivate a cohesive, professional, and authentic visual identity that effectively avoids the common pitfalls of the "uncanny valley" or generic stock photography. This approach necessitates careful selection of AI tools and precise prompting strategies to ensure the imagery resonates with the target audience while maintaining artistic integrity.

### Recommended Tools and Techniques

To achieve optimal results, a multi-tool approach is recommended, leveraging the strengths of different AI image generation platforms [1].

| Tool | Best Use Case | Key Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Midjourney v6** | Hero images and artistic backgrounds | Offers superior artistic flair, sophisticated composition, and "cinematic" lighting effects, ideal for impactful visual storytelling [1]. |
| **Adobe Firefly** | Realistic human anatomy and action shots | Excels in generating images with accurate human anatomy and dynamic poses, crucial for depicting dance movements realistically. It also offers commercial safety due to its training data [1]. |
| **DALL-E 3** | Complex scenes with specific props or narratives | Demonstrates strong adherence to complex prompts, allowing for detailed scene construction and the inclusion of specific elements relevant to dance styles or demographics [1]. |

### Prompting Strategies for Authenticity

To ensure AI-generated images appear authentic and avoid a synthetic or generic look, specific prompting strategies should be employed. These strategies focus on capturing movement, emotion, and realistic textures [2].

*   **Motion and Energy:** Incorporate keywords such as `motion blur`, `dynamic action`, `energetic pose`, `sweat beads`, and `flowing fabric` to convey movement and vitality.
*   **Lighting and Atmosphere:** Specify `cinematic lighting`, `rim lighting`, `golden hour`, `studio lighting`, or `stage lighting` to add depth, mood, and professionalism to the visuals.
*   **Authenticity and Realism:** Use terms like `candid shot`, `unfiltered`, `natural skin texture`, `realistic`, and `documentary style` to counter overly polished or artificial outputs.
*   **Dance Specificity:** Employ technical dance terms (e.g., `grand jeté`, `pirouette`, `breaking freeze`, `k-pop formation`, `salsa dip`) to guide the AI in generating accurate and recognizable dance movements.
*   **Visual Styles:** Consider `cinematic photography` for high contrast and dramatic visuals, `abstract movement` using light trails or silhouettes for artistic expression, or `illustration/minimalism` for clean lines and a focus on form, especially when a less photographic style is desired [2].

## 2. Credibility Building (Starting from Zero Online Presence)

Given that Dance Connexions currently lacks an online presence, establishing credibility and trust with first-time website visitors is paramount. The studio's long operational history (since 1999) is a significant asset that must be strategically leveraged [3].

### Trust Signals and Content Elements

Several key elements can be integrated into the website design and content to build trust effectively [3, 4].

*   **Highlighting Longevity:** Position the studio as a "Hidden Gem of Sunway" or a "Long-Standing Community Pillar." Prominently feature copy such as *"Nurturing dancers in Bandar Sunway for over 25 years, Dance Connexions has been a cornerstone of our community since 1999."* This emphasizes stability and experience without making unsubstantiated claims.
*   **Founder's Story and Philosophy:** Dedicate a detailed "About Us" section to the founder's journey, their passion for dance, teaching philosophy, and any relevant certifications or accolades. This humanizes the brand and provides a personal connection [3].
*   **Risk-Free Entry Offers:** To lower the barrier to entry for new students, prominently feature offers like "First Class on Us" or an "Introductory Week Package." This demonstrates confidence in the studio's offerings and reduces perceived risk for potential customers [4].
*   **Professional Website Experience:** A high-speed, mobile-optimized, and intuitively designed user interface (UI) is a fundamental trust signal. A clean, modern aesthetic conveys professionalism and attention to detail [3].
*   **Clear Contact Information:** Ensure all contact details, including physical address, phone number, and email, are easily accessible. In the Malaysian context, a readily available WhatsApp contact is crucial for immediate communication and builds significant trust [5].
*   **Transparency:** Clearly outline class schedules, pricing structures, and studio policies. Transparency fosters trust and reduces uncertainty for prospective students and their parents.

## 3. Demographic-Specific Landing Pages

Each of the five demographic-targeted landing pages must function as a standalone conversion funnel, optimized for traffic originating from social media advertisements. The design, copy, and calls-to-action (CTAs) should be tailored to the unique motivations, fears, and preferences of each audience segment [6].

## 4. Router/Home Page Design

The home page for Dance Connexions will serve as a crucial "audience selector" or "routing" page. Its primary objective is to segment visitors within the first 3 seconds of arrival, directing them efficiently to the most relevant demographic-specific landing page [14].

### Design Patterns and Best Practices

*   **The "Choose Your Path" Grid:** The most effective pattern involves a prominent grid of visually distinct cards, typically a 2x3 or 3x2 layout, each representing one of the five demographic segments plus a general "About Us" or "Explore All Classes" option [14, 15].
*   **Visual Techniques for Recognition:** Each card should feature a representative AI-generated image that immediately resonates with its target demographic. For instance, the "Parents" card might show a happy child dancing, while the "Teens" card could feature energetic K-Pop moves. The use of distinct color schemes for each card can further aid rapid identification [15].
*   **Compelling and Direct Copy:** Instead of generic labels like "For Kids," the copy on each card should be phrased from the visitor's perspective, such as "I am a Parent looking for my child's first dance class" or "I want to learn K-Pop and meet new friends." This direct address creates immediate relevance and encourages clicks [14].
*   **Minimizing Bounce Rate:** To prevent immediate bouncing, the hero section of the router page should be visually engaging and clearly communicate the studio's core value proposition (e.g., "Your Journey in Dance Starts Here"). The audience selector grid should be immediately visible above the fold [14].
*   **Secondary Content (Below the Fold):** While the primary focus is routing, a brief section below the fold can include:
    *   **"Our Story" (Since 1999):** A concise paragraph highlighting the studio's long history and commitment to the community, leveraging the key credibility factor.
    *   **"Why Dance Connexions?":** A short section outlining unique selling propositions.
    *   **General Contact Information:** A clear call to action for general inquiries, potentially linking to a WhatsApp chat [5].

## 5. Malaysia-Specific Considerations

Integrating local cultural nuances and preferences is vital for the website's success in the Malaysian market, particularly in the Klang Valley/Sunway area [16].

### Cultural and Design Nuances

*   **Modesty in Imagery:** It is crucial to ensure that all AI-generated imagery reflects local cultural sensibilities, especially for the Malay audience. This means depicting dancers in modest attire, avoiding overly revealing outfits, and being mindful of poses that might be considered inappropriate [16].
*   **Language and Tone:** While British English is the standard in Malaysia, the website's tone should be warm, community-focused, and approachable. Subtle incorporation of local nuances or "Manglish" in less formal copy can foster a sense of familiarity and connection with the audience [16].
*   **Payment Integration:** Malaysian consumers have strong preferences for local digital payment methods. The website must prominently display and integrate logos for **DuitNow QR**, **GrabPay**, and **Touch 'n Go eWallet**. These are widely used and trusted payment gateways in Malaysia [17, 18].
*   **The "WhatsApp" Culture:** WhatsApp is a dominant communication tool in Malaysia, particularly for inquiries and decision-making, especially among parents researching activities for their children [5]. A floating WhatsApp button should be present on all pages, offering direct and immediate communication with the studio.
*   **Family Decision-Making:** For parents, the website should provide comprehensive information on class structure, safety, instructor qualifications, and testimonials. The flow of information should anticipate questions typically asked by Malaysian families when choosing extracurricular activities [5].

## Actionable Recommendations for Claude Code

To facilitate efficient development and ensure the website meets the outlined specifications, the following technical recommendations are provided for Claude Code:

1.  **Technology Stack:** Utilize **Next.js** for the frontend framework, paired with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. This combination ensures high performance, excellent SEO capabilities, and a streamlined development workflow.

4.  **Conversion Flow:** Integrate a simple lead capture form on each landing page. Upon submission, this form should redirect users to a WhatsApp chat with a pre-filled message, streamlining the inquiry process.
5.  **Mobile-First Design:** Prioritize a mobile-first design approach, given the high mobile internet usage in Malaysia.
6.  **Accessibility:** Ensure the website adheres to basic accessibility standards, particularly for the Active Adults (50+) demographic, including clear font sizes and sufficient color contrast.
