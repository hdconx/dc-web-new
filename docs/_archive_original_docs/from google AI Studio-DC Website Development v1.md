# 📂 PROJECT ARCHIVE: THE MOVEMENT ECOSYSTEM
**Date of Record:** October 2023 (Refined for Next.js 15 Environment)  
**Project Status:** Technical Architecture Phase  

---

### 1. CORE BUSINESS FACTS
*   **Location:** Bandar Sunway (Identified as the primary target area for SEO and AI-search "gold").
*   **Physical Infrastructure:** 
    *   The studio is a physical brick-and-mortar space.
    *   Compliant with **MBSJ** (Subang Jaya City Council) regulations and approval status.
    *   Maintain an active/verified **Google Business Profile**.
*   **Service Segmentation (Demographic-First):** 
    *   **Kids:** Ages 5–9 (Focus: Playful, Movement, Confidence).
    *   **Teens:** Ages 10–17 (Focus: K-Pop, Modern, Expression).
    *   **Young Adults:** Ages 18–30 (Focus: Social, Stress Release, Meeting People).
    *   **Adults:** Ages 30–49 (Focus: Fitness, Balance, "Me time").
    *   **Active Adults/Seniors:** Ages 50+ (Focus: Joint safety, Brain health, Friendship, Dignity).
    *   **Professionals:** Dedicated segment for studio rentals and technical needs.

### 2. THE "PREMISES RENTAL" SECTION
*   **Progress Status:** Logic finalized as a "Professional / Studio Rental" tile on the homepage.
*   **Core Logic:** This is a separate visual universe from the dance classes. It uses a "clean, technical, and precise" visual language rather than lifestyle/emotional imagery.
*   **Developed Structure:** 
    *   Direct path to technical specs (floor type, dimensions, equipment).
    *   Bypass of the "beginner/lifestyle" filtering questions.
    *   Contextual WhatsApp CTA: The system must inform the owner that the lead is specifically inquiring about professional rental, not classes.
*   **Rules/Pricing:** 
    *   Must be "Headless" (the website provides all technical answers so the owner doesn't have to).
    *   Automated availability/booking inquiry logic via the tech stack.

### 3. OWNER PROFILE & CONSTRAINTS
*   **Personality:** Introverted; prefers high-efficiency, low-friction interactions. The goal is to minimize unnecessary "cold" customer service chats.
*   **Interaction Model:** Prefers "warm leads" where the customer has already been filtered by the website and knows they belong there before reaching out.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** 
    *   High proficiency with **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** and **Command Line Interfaces (CLI)**.
    *   Experienced with **Docker Desktop** for maintaining consistent, containerized development environments.
    *   Capable of managing AI coding assistants (Gemini, Claude Code, V0).
*   **Budget/Management:** 
    *   **Zero/Low-Cost Preference:** Focus on high-value, open-source, or industry-standard tools that don't require expensive monthly retainers.
    *   **No Outsourcing:** The project is a DIY build leveraging AI agents; no professional web agencies are to be hired.
    *   **Management Style:** "Headless operation"—the website acts as the advisor/filter so the owner can focus on the studio, not the admin.

### 4. TECH STACK & TOOLS (Finalized)
*   **Frontend Framework:** **Next.js 15 (App Router)**—chosen for speed, SEO, and AI-friendliness.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn/UI** (Radix UI primitives).
*   **Database & Backend:** 
    *   **PostgreSQL** (Primary Database).
    *   **Prisma ORM** (Type-safe database management).
    *   **Next.js Server Actions** for API logic.
*   **Development Workflow:** 
    *   **Docker Desktop:** To containerize the Node.js environment and PostgreSQL DB.
    *   **V0.dev:** For rapid UI component prototyping.
    *   **Deployment:** **Vercel** (preferred for Next.js 15 compatibility).
*   **Strategic Integrations:** WhatsApp-based CTAs with context-specific pre-filled messages.

### 5. STRATEGIC VISION
*   **"Filtering Intelligence" Concept:** The website is not a menu; it is a system that makes the user "feel seen" by identifying their life stage before showing them a dance style.
*   **AI-Search Optimization:** 
    *   Use of **JSON-LD Schema Markup** (Person, Event, Place) to make the studio "readable" by AI search engines and LLMs.
    *   Clean internal linking based on demographic keywords (e.g., "Dance for 50+ in Bandar Sunway").
*   **B2B/Teacher Outreach:** The "Professionals" tile serves as the gateway for external instructors and collaborators to view the studio as a resource.
*   **Marketing Angle:** Identity-based belonging. Moving away from "Beginner Classes" and moving toward "Dance for Young Adults" or "Confidence for Teens."
*   **Mobile-First Rule:** Vertical stacks, large tap areas, and "Instagram Story" style navigation.
