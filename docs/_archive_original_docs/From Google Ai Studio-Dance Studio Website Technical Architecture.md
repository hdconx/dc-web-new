This **Master Planning Archive** consolidates all facts, constraints, and decisions provided by you during the architectural phase of "The Movement Ecosystem." As your Data Archivist, I have extracted the following "Source of Truth":

### 1. CORE BUSINESS FACTS
*   **Studio Identity:** Dance Connexions.
*   **Location:** Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.
*   **Legacy:** Established and serving the community since 1999.
*   **Physical Premises:**
    *   Purpose-built dance space designed by dancers.
    *   Attributes: High-end wide-angle mirrors, professional "joint-safe" flooring, and full air-conditioning.
    *   Ambiance: Cinematic, clean, and minimalist "luxury lifestyle" aesthetic.
*   **Demographic Segments:** The business is categorized into six "Micro-Universes":
    1.  Kids (5–9)
    2.  Teens (10–17)
    3.  Young Adults (18–30)
    4.  Adults (30–49)
    5.  Active Adults & Seniors (50+)
    6.  Professionals & Rentals.
*   **Legal/Admin:** 
    *   MBSJ (Subang Jaya City Council) approval status is a finalized/tracked data point.
    *   Google Business Profile is a core component of the digital footprint.

### 2. THE "PREMISES RENTAL" SECTION
*   **Integration:** Positioned as the 6th tile in the "Identity Entry" grid.
*   **Visual Structure:** 
    *   Uses a split-screen layout (60% imagery / 40% text panel) on the detail page.
    *   Specific sub-spaces identified: Main Studio, Mirror Studio, Recording Space, and Creative Studio.
*   **Rental Logic & Pricing Models:** 
    *   Developed pricing tiers for Group Classes, Semi-Private sessions, Private sessions, and Drop-in fees.
    *   The system must support "Space Only" rentals for professionals.
*   **UI Progress:** Components for "Studio Visuals" (Gallery) and "Universal Values" (Amenities icons) are finalized.
*   **CTA Logic:** Links directly to a contextual WhatsApp inquiry specifically for rental/professional availability.

### 3. OWNER PROFILE & CONSTRAINTS
*   **Personality:** Introverted; strong preference for systems that minimize direct, repetitive customer interaction.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** High. Proficient in VS Code, Command Line Interface (CLI), AI prompt engineering, and the Open Source ecosystem.
*   **Management Style:** "Headless" operation. The goal is maximum automation, specifically regarding bookings and the "Filtering Intelligence" routing.
*   **Financial Constraints:** Zero/Low-cost development model. Strictly DIY; no external professional hiring.
*   **Development Workflow:** Design-First. No code is committed until the UI is "ironed out" in v0.dev.

### 4. TECH STACK & TOOLS
*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) using TypeScript.
*   **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI (Radix UI primitives).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL managed via Prisma ORM.
*   **Deployment/Dev Environment:** 
    *   Fully containerized using Docker (Next.js container + Postgres container).
    *   Local development on Docker Desktop for Windows (WSL2 environment).
*   **AI Integration:** Use of v0.dev for component generation and AI personas (Lead Architect, Studio Manager) for decision support.
*   **SEO/Machine Readability:** Strict adherence to Semantic HTML5 and high-fidelity JSON-LD (Schema.org) for LLM scraping.

### 5. STRATEGIC VISION
*   **The "Filtering Intelligence" System:** Moving away from traditional "menus" to a routing engine that prioritizes user identity (Age/Life Stage) over class styles.
*   **Next Gen AI Concept:** Every page is architected to be "AI-Friendly," ensuring that LLMs can scrape the studio's offerings, pricing, and schedule with perfect accuracy.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Information is hidden until it is demographically relevant (e.g., Seniors don't see Teen Hip Hop pricing).
*   **B2B & Teacher Outreach:** The "Professionals" tile serves as a dedicated portal for building a B2B ecosystem for guest teachers and studio renters.
*   **User Journey:**
    1.  **Identity Entry** (Visual Grid)
    2.  **Emotional Hook** ("You Belong Here")
    3.  **Anxiety Killers** (FAQ Snapshot/Beginner Reassurance)
    4.  **Conversion** (Context-aware WhatsApp CTA).

This archive is now finalized. I am ready to use this "Source of Truth" for the next phase of development or further design refinement. **How would you like to proceed?**
