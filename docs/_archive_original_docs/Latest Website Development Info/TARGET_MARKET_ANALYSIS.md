Malaysia recently transitioned from B40/M40/T20 to disposable income-based classification, but these terms still widely used:

- **B40 (Bottom 40%, ~RM 3,860 monthly income):** Price-sensitive, needs payment plans, seeks community programs
- **M40 (Middle 40%, RM 3,860-RM 8,320):** Value-conscious, seeks quality within budget
- **T20 (Top 20%, >RM 8,320):** Less price-sensitive, invests in skills/wellness

**Pricing Strategy:** Offer tiered options or "pay what you can" community classes alongside premium programs.

### **4. FAMILY-CENTRIC CULTURE**

- **Kids classes as family bonding:** Parents seek communal experience
- **Multigenerational:** Grandparents, parents, kids together
- **WhatsApp networks:** Parent communities critical for word-of-mouth
- **Family events/showcases:** Major decision-making moment
- **Safety prioritization:** Parents thoroughly vet before enrolling

### **5. SEARCH BEHAVIOR SHIFT**

- **Gen Z & Millennials prefer social platforms for discovery** (TikTok, Instagram > Google)
- **Older demographics remain Google-reliant** (Google > social media)
- **Hybrid journey:** Online discovery → Offline validation (trial class required)
- **Hybrid checkout:** Many research online but call/visit to confirm

### **6. TREND: WELLNESS & MENTAL HEALTH**

Post-pandemic, Malaysians increasingly value:
- Stress relief & mental wellness
- Community & social connection
- Holistic health (mind + body)
- Dance recognized as legitimate wellness intervention

**Marketing Angle:** Position dance as "wellness", not just "fitness" or "hobby".

### **7. GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION**

- **Urban centers (KL, PJ, Subang, Bangsar):** Highest demand
- **Location crucial:** Commute time = major decision factor
- **Parking essential:** Especially for adults with limited time
- **Regional expansion potential:** Suburbs (Setapak, Ampang) growing demand
