## What Doesn't Work (Confusing, Alienating, Generic)

1. **Limited visual hierarchy clarity:** (Inferred from description) May not be obvious which section to click for your age group on mobile
2. **Neon aesthetic might alienate older users:** Very trendy, could feel "not for me" to 55+ demographic
3. **Hero video may be too fast-cut:** Older users might miss key information
4. **If schedule is hidden:** Being able to see available classes at a glance would be stronger
