### Content

**Activity Constraints (High-Impact Activities Restricted)**

The following activity characteristics require extra scrutiny or are generally avoided:
- High-impact jumping
- Falling / rolling techniques
- Contact-based or aggressive movement
- Activities with uncontrolled momentum toward mirrors

Examples to avoid:
- Martial arts (even "non-contact" forms with falls)
- Combat sports
- Parkour-style training
- Stunt rehearsals involving falls

**Reasoning:**
- Studios feature wall-to-wall high mirrors
- Risk of mirror breakage and injury
- Floor surface optimized for dance & fitness, not impact training

**AI Guidance:** If inquiry includes words like sparring, falls, throws, combat, impact → escalate to manual review or polite redirection.

### Notes

Critical safety information. Should be integrated into usage-rules.md during next review.

**Related Sections:** Marketing, Website Strategy
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Strategic Context

### Content

**Marketing Position — Starting From Zero**

Current reality (as of 2026-01):
- No established social media presence
- No existing customer reviews (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- No customer photos or testimonials to showcase
- No user-generated content (UGC) available
- Previous online presence needs complete rebuild

**Implication for AI/Website:**
- Cannot rely on social proof from past customers
- Cannot use "trusted by X renters" type messaging yet
- Cannot showcase UGC gallery until content is collected
- Must use creative, feature-based marketing instead
- Website must demonstrate professionalism through design and information quality

**Marketing Philosophy — No Competitor Bashing**

Strict rule: Never disparage or negatively compare to competitors.

**Not allowed:**
- "Unlike other studios that..."
- "While competitors charge hidden fees..."
- Naming competitors negatively
- Creating animosity or adversarial positioning

**Preferred approach:**
- Highlight own strengths positively
- Let features speak for themselves
- Focus on what DC offers, not what others lack
- Build relationships, not rivalries

**AI Guidance:** Always use positive framing. Instead of "We don't have hidden fees like others," say "Transparent pricing — the price you see is the price you pay."

**Content Strategy — Building Without Past Customers**

Since UGC and testimonials are not available initially, focus on:

**Website Strategy:**
- Professional, well-designed pages signal credibility
- Comprehensive information reduces uncertainty
- Easy navigation shows competence
- Clear pricing builds trust
- The website itself IS the social proof (shows capable people run this)

**Social Media Strategy:**
- Create original content showcasing the spaces
- Behind-the-scenes of the studios
- "Day in the life" style content
- Feature the rooms, equipment, amenities
- Aspirational content: "Imagine running your class here"

**Trust-Building Without Reviews:**
- Emphasize longevity: "Established 1999" (25+ years)
- Show the physical space extensively
- Offer free viewing visits
- Responsive communication
- Professional website presence

**Future Collection:**
- As customers come, actively request reviews
- Ask permission to feature their content
- Build UGC gallery over time
- This is a growth process, not immediate

**AI Guidance:** When creating content, focus on FEATURES and POSSIBILITIES, not social proof. Show what the space can do, not what others say about it.

**Related Sections:** Classes, Services, Booking
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Business Strategy

### Content

**Class Offerings Strategy — On-Demand Teacher Model**

Philosophy: List classes we CAN deliver, not just what's currently scheduled.

**Current Regular Offerings:**
- Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Bachata
- Jazz, Youth classes, Adult classes
- Private lessons, Choreography

**Can Offer On-Demand (arrange teacher if inquired):**
- K-pop dance classes
- Hip-hop
- Contemporary
- Other dance styles per request

**Previously Offered, Can Offer Again:**
- Yoga classes
- Dance fitness (Zumba, Salsation, etc.)

**Business Logic:**
- We have the space and facilities
- We can arrange qualified teachers
- Better to list capabilities and fulfill on-demand
- Than to restrict listings to currently scheduled classes only

**AI Guidance:** When creating marketing materials or listing services, include K-pop, Hip-hop, Contemporary, Yoga, and Dance Fitness even if not currently scheduled. If inquired, respond: "We can arrange [class type] with qualified instructors. Let's discuss your needs."

### Notes

This demand-driven approach maximizes business opportunities without overpromising. As long as we can deliver (by arranging teachers), it's legitimate to list the service.

### Content

**Studio A — Premium Design Features**

**Important Correction:** Studio A is NOT a basic white-wall studio. It's a professionally designed premium space.

**Actual Features:**
- Purple/dark ceiling with recessed lighting
- Red architectural accent strips
- Green accent strips
- White suspended ceiling panel with red border
- Orange cushioned seating area
- Red curtains
- Polished light wooden floor
- Floor-to-ceiling mirrors
- Professional pendant lighting
- Modern, theatrical aesthetic

**Marketing Implication:**
- This is a HIGH-END facility, not basic practice space
- Design differentiates from competitors
- Premium look justifies premium pricing
- Photos and videos should showcase architectural features
- This is a designed performance space, not converted room

**Competitor Comparison:**
- Most studios: basic mirrors + white walls
- Dance Connexions Studio A: architectural design elements, color scheme, professional aesthetic

**AI Guidance:** When describing Studio A, emphasize "professionally designed", "premium finishes", "architectural features", "theatrical quality space". Don't undersell by calling it "simple" or "basic".

### Notes

**Type:** Technical Tools

### Content

**Video Creation Tools & Strategy**

**Available Tools:**

1. **Google Veo 3.1** (Primary recommendation)
   - Access via: Google Flow / Gemini Advanced (user has subscription)
   - Capability: Generate 8-second videos from uploaded photos
   - Strength: Accurately recreates actual studio appearance
   - Test video created: /mnt/c/users/nvntr/documents/dc-web-new/media/Create_professional_looking_202601301338_cju2.mp4
   - Quality: High-quality, realistic, suitable for professional use

2. **Grok Video Generation** (Alternative)
   - X/Twitter platform
   - Similar capabilities to Veo
   - User testing as backup option

3. **CapCut** (Editing tool - FREE)
   - Recommended for editing multiple Veo clips together
   - Ken Burns effect for static photos
   - Transitions, text overlays, music

**Video Creation Strategy:**

**Multi-Shot Approach:**
- Generate 5-6 different camera angle shots per room (8 sec each)
- Camera movements: dolly in/out, pan left/right, tilt up/down, diagonal sweep, zoom
- Edit together into 30-60 second comprehensive showcase
- More engaging than single static pan

**Prompt Strategy for Veo/Grok:**
- Upload studio photo
- Prompt describes ONLY camera movement (not room details)
- AI extracts room details from photo automatically
- Example: "Slow smooth pan from left to right across the room, steady camera at eye level"

**For Static Photos:**
- Ken Burns effect (slow zoom + pan)
- Multi-photo carousels
- Photo + graphics overlays
- Color grading to modernize look

### Notes

User has successfully tested Veo and achieved good results. This is viable path for creating professional video content without expensive videography equipment or services.

**Website Status — Currently Offline**

**danceconnexions.com Status:**
- Connection refused (not responding)
- Website is NOT currently live
- Domain may exist but no hosting/server active

**Implication:**
- Zero online presence currently (confirms "starting from zero")

**New Website Project:**
- Repository: dc-web-new
- Location: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new

## S-2026-01-31-07

**Related Sections:** Website Development, UX Design
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Design Pattern

### Content

**Button Styling Hierarchy — Website Pattern**

Established consistent button hierarchy for all Dance Connexions website pages:

**PRIMARY Buttons (Solid Emerald):**
- Purpose: Generate leads, bookings, inquiries (direct conversion actions)
- Style: `bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-500 text-white`
- Shadow: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl` for major CTAs
- Examples: "Check Availability", "Inquire About Room", "Get Custom Quote", "Book Now"

**SECONDARY Buttons (Outlined):**
- Purpose: Navigation, information access, supplementary actions
- Style: `border-2 border-slate-600 text-slate-300 hover:border-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-400`
- Variant (emphasized): `border-2 border-emerald-600 text-emerald-400 hover:bg-emerald-600 hover:text-white`
- Examples: "Browse Rooms", "View Gallery", "View Pricing", "Compare", "Open in Maps"

**Rationale:**
- Too many solid green buttons create visual noise and dilute primary CTAs
- Outlined buttons are visible without overwhelming
- Hover states provide clear interaction feedback
- Material UI-inspired design feels modern and professional

**AI Guidance:** When creating new pages or modifying existing ones, maintain this hierarchy. Never use solid green for non-conversion actions. All navigation should use outlined style.

### Notes

Applied across rentals landing page. Should be replicated on all other pages for consistency.

**Google Business Profile Optimization — Complete Guide**

Created comprehensive step-by-step GBP optimization guide at `/docs/GBP_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`.

**Critical Missing Element Identified:**
- Studio rental services are COMPLETELY ABSENT from current GBP
- This is why rentals don't appear in search
- Adding "Event venue" category + rental services is highest priority

**Key Optimizations Documented:**
1. Updated business description (includes classes + rentals)
2. Studio rental services (3 new services to add)
3. Missing dance styles (K-pop, Hip-hop, Contemporary, etc.)
4. Photo upload strategy (15-20 photos with captions)
5. Amenities, parking, payment methods (all currently missing)
6. Communication (Google Messages or WhatsApp link)
7. Social profiles (Instagram, Facebook - create if needed)
8. Secondary categories (Event venue, Dance hall, etc.)
9. First post template
10. Q&A entries (5 ready-to-use)
11. Review collection system

**Implementation Time:**
- Full optimization: 30-45 minutes
- Quick start version: 30 minutes

**Expected Impact:**
- Appear in "studio rental Bandar Sunway" searches
- Appear in "event space rental" searches
- Higher local search ranking
- More WhatsApp inquiries

**AI Guidance:** Guide is copy-paste ready. User can execute independently. AI can answer questions or review profile after optimization.

### Notes

GBP was severely underutilized. Primary business (dance classes) represented, but secondary revenue stream (studio rentals) completely missing from profile.

**Activities Explicitly NOT Suitable for Our Studios**

The following activities should NOT be marketed or accepted due to safety concerns or competitive disadvantages:

Room A positioning enhanced to highlight fashion/modeling capabilities, leveraging RGB lighting and stage platform. These features differentiate Room A as suitable for professional fashion and theatrical events, not just dance.

**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Content Strategy
**Date:** 2026-02-01

### Content

**Refined Activity Categories for Marketing**

**Principles Applied:**
1. Use popular, recognizable examples (not niche terms)
2. Show breadth without appearing limited
3. Avoid unclear terminology ("masterclasses", "movement workshops", "stage movement coaching")
4. Include obvious mainstream activities
5. Don't list activities requiring specialized heavy equipment

**Dance & Movement:**
- Removed: Ballet (no barres)
- Emphasis: Hip-hop, contemporary, ballroom, K-pop, line dancing, belly dancing, Latin dance

**Fitness & Wellness:**
- Lead with: Dance fitness (Zumba, Salsation)
- Include: Yoga, fitness training, aerobics, stretching
- Removed: Pilates (can't compete), barre (no equipment), martial arts (safety), conditioning (too specific)

**Performing Arts:**
- Added: Theatre & drama classes, fashion shows, catwalk practice, talent showcases
- Removed: "Performance practice & run-throughs" (unclear), "Stage movement coaching" (unclear)

**Content Creation:**
- Specify platforms: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube
- Include: Product launches, livestream sessions, online course recording
- Broadened from just "dance & fitness photography"

**Workshops & Studio Parties:**
- Section renamed from "Workshops & Events"
- Added: Birthday parties, team building, corporate events
- Removed: "Masterclasses" (unclear), "movement workshops" (unclear), "small group learning" (misleading about capacity)

### Notes

Content strategy refined during 2026-02-01 landing page review. Focus shifted to mainstream, popular activities with clear terminology. Removes confusion and broadens appeal to wider audience.

**Base Hourly Rates Clarity**

**Table Header Changes:**
- Subtitle: "One-hour rental rates (starting prices)" 
- Column header: "Per Hour" (not "From")

**Purpose:**
Clearly communicate that published rates are for ONE HOUR rentals, avoiding confusion about whether rates are per hour, per session, or per day.

**Discount Messaging:**
"Substantial discounts available" for:
- Multi-hour bookings
- Weekly classes  
- Long-term commitments
- Students, seniors, studio members, non-profits, regulars
- Off-peak timing, bulk bookings
- Custom packages for unique needs

### Notes

Pricing transparency improved to set correct expectations upfront. Word "substantial" emphasizes that significant savings are available for most renters.

### Content

**Pricing Page Strategy - Shift to Customized Quotes Only**

**Decision:** 
Removed percentage-based discount tables from public pricing page. Strategy shifted to personalized pricing upon contact only.

**Rationale:**
1. Discount criteria is complex and scenario-dependent
2. Public transparency makes it difficult to justify different pricing strategies for different customers
3. Different rental types require different considerations (event proximity, setup, customer type, duration, frequency)
4. Better to keep discount criteria internal and provide correct rate upon customer contact

**New Pricing Page Approach:**
- Explains WHY pricing is customized (affordability, flexibility, willingness to discuss needs)
- Shows base rates as reference starting points only
- Emphasizes substantial discounts available
- Encourages contact for personalized quotes
- Lists seasonal promotions and special rates

**All "View Pricing" Links Removed From:**
- Rentals landing page (quick links section & pricing section)
- Rooms listing page
- Room detail pages (replaced with "Studio Gallery")
- Compare page (replaced with single "View All Rooms" button)
- Book page (replaced with "Compare Rooms")

### Notes

Major strategic shift decided during 2026-02-02 gallery/compare/pricing page review. Prioritizes flexibility and relationship-building over rigid published rates.

**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Clarification
**Date:** 2026-02-02

### Content

**Capacity Guidelines - Specific Scenarios Instead of Broad Categories**

**Problem with Previous Approach:**
- Broad terms like "Dance" are too generic
- Ballroom dancing (couples) has different capacity than K-pop (individual dancers)
- Different activities have very different space requirements

**New Approach - Specific Realistic Scenarios:**
- "K-pop / Hip-hop dance classes" (individual dancers, active movement)
- "Ballroom dancing (couples)" - capacity shown as number of couples, not individuals
- "Workshops & training sessions" (seated/semi-active)
- "Yoga / Zumba / Group fitness" (mat-based or structured exercise)
- "Content creation / Video shoots" (crew, equipment, subjects)

**Capacity Display Format:**
- REMOVED: Minimum capacity (not necessary)
- SHOW: Ideal capacity (bold) and maximum capacity (smaller text)
- Example: "25 (max 35)" means 25 ideal, 35 maximum

**Disclaimer Added:**
"These are ballpark guidance figures only. Actual capacity varies based on activity type, setup requirements, and comfort preferences."

### Notes

Shift from generic to specific scenarios provides more realistic guidance for renters. Helps them visualize actual use cases rather than abstract categories.

**Room "Best For" Lists - Consolidated and Reduced**

**Previous Problem:**
- 22 separate use cases across all rooms
- High redundancy (e.g., "Content creation" vs "Content creation (large scale)" vs "Solo content creation")
- Overlapping categories ("Small group classes" vs "Medium dance classes")
- Too long for compare page

**New Consolidated List (7 main categories):**
1. **Group classes with size ranges**
   - "Large group classes (30-50 people)" - Room A
   - "Medium group classes (10-25 people)" - Room D
   - "Small group classes (6-15 people)" - Room B
   - "Small group classes (2-8 people)" - Room C

2. **Workshops and training events** - Room A, D

3. **Private rehearsals and coaching** - Room B, C, D

4. **Fitness and wellness classes** - Room A, D

5. **Video and content production** - All rooms

6. **Dance rehearsals and performances** - Room A

7. **Fashion shows and runway practice** - Room A only

8. **Theatrical productions** - Room A only

**Removed Redundant Items:**
- "Extension of Room A events" (only applicable to Room B, too specific)
- Separate "Private practice sessions" and "1-on-1 lessons" (consolidated into "Private rehearsals and coaching")
- "Audition preparation" (covered under private coaching)
- Multiple variations of content creation

### Notes

Streamlined from 22 items to ~7-8 core categories. Easier to scan on compare page while maintaining clarity about which rooms suit which activities.

**Room Sorting Order - Alphabetical (A, B, C, D)**

**Decision:** 
Changed from size-based sorting to alphabetical sorting.

**Previous Order (by size):**
- Room A (1,200 sqft) - sortOrder: 1
- Room D (700 sqft) - sortOrder: 2
- Room B (400 sqft) - sortOrder: 3
- Room C (300 sqft) - sortOrder: 4

**New Order (alphabetical):**
- Room A - sortOrder: 1
- Room B - sortOrder: 2
- Room C - sortOrder: 3
- Room D - sortOrder: 4

**Rationale:**
- Alphabetical order is easier to remember and navigate
- Consistent with natural room naming convention
- Trade-off: Room D (2nd largest) now appears last, but simplicity wins

**Applies To:**
- Compare page column order
- Rooms listing page
- Landing page studio cards
- All navigation and room selection interfaces

### Notes

User chose alphabetical over size-based sorting when presented with options. Prioritizes simplicity and memorability over showcasing room hierarchy by size.

**Additional Discount Opportunities and Seasonal Promos**

**Room A Pricing Section Enhanced:**
Added notes beyond the standard discount categories:
- "Plus many other discount opportunities!"
- "Special promos during festive seasons (New Year, etc.). Contact us to discuss your needs!"

**Rationale:**
- Standard discount list (multi-hour, weekly, long-term, students/seniors/members) doesn't capture all scenarios
- Many edge cases and special circumstances warrant discounts
- Seasonal promotions (New Year, CNY, etc.) are planned but not yet defined
- Keeps door open for negotiations without committing to specific percentage discounts

**Status:** Confirmed - CRITICAL RESTRICTION
**Type:** Strategic Exclusion
**Date:** 2026-02-02

### Content

**NEVER Include These Activities in Any Offerings or Calculators**

**PILATES:**
- REASON: Multiple well-equipped Pilates studios nearby (impossible to compete)
- Competitors have specialized equipment (reformers, Cadillac, chairs)
- Cannot offer competitive Pilates experience
- DO NOT include in: Capacity calculator, activity lists, marketing materials, room recommendations

**MARTIAL ARTS / BOXING / COMBAT SPORTS:**
- REASON 1: Safety - Wall-to-wall mirrors are fragile and dangerous for martial arts
- REASON 2: Equipment - No protective rubber mats, no punching bags, no padding
- REASON 3: Competition - Martial arts dojos and weight gyms nearby are better equipped
- DO NOT include in: Capacity calculator, activity lists, marketing materials

**WEIGHT TRAINING / GYM ACTIVITIES:**
- REASON: Weight gyms nearby are better equipped
- We have no weight equipment, benches, or gym facilities
- DO NOT market as gym alternative

**CORPORATE / BUSINESS WORKSHOPS (Non-Dance):**
- REASON: These are offered separately in event space business website
- DO NOT include seated workshops, business training, corporate events in dance studio offerings
- ONLY include: Dance workshops, movement training, performance workshops

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
- Review all marketing materials and remove these activities
- Update capacity calculator to exclude these categories
- Train AI/staff to never suggest these activities
- If customer inquires about these, explain we specialize in dance/movement activities

### Notes

This restriction reinforced during capacity calculator implementation (2026-02-02). Previously documented in S-2026-02-01-02 but needs stronger emphasis as it keeps appearing in activity lists. This is a STRATEGIC decision based on competitive landscape and facility limitations.

### Content

**Capacity Calculator - Remove Subjective Labels and Color Coding**

**Problem Identified:**
Capacity calculator was highlighting results as "good" or "ideal" with green color coding and graying out "non-ideal" results. This was flawed because:
- System doesn't know how many attendees the user actually needs
- Someone needing 8 people doesn't care that a room fits 30
- Someone needing 25 people doesn't want smaller capacities grayed out as "bad"
- Subjective labels ("Good capacity", "Excellent - plenty of space", "Too small") were presumptuous

**Changes Made:**
- Removed ALL subjective labels and notes
- Removed color coding that differentiated "ideal" vs "non-ideal" results
- Display all capacity numbers equally with consistent emerald color
- Changed "Recommended Capacity" → "Estimated Capacity" (more neutral)
- Added subtle hover effect for better UX
- Let users make their own decisions based on objective numbers

**Implementation:**
- Updated `src/lib/capacity-calculator.ts` - removed `isIdeal` and `note` fields
- Updated `src/app/rentals/compare/page.tsx` - equal display for all results
- Updated `src/app/rentals/room/[id]/page.tsx` - removed subjective note display

**Future Enhancement Planned:**
- Show BOTH optimal capacity (comfortable spacing) AND maximum capacity (tighter spacing)
- Give users range instead of single number
- Let them choose based on their comfort level and budget

### Notes

Critical UX fix based on user feedback. Calculator now shows objective data only without making assumptions about user needs. Future enhancement will provide optimal vs maximum capacity range for even more flexibility.

**Related Sections:** Promotions, Website Features
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** New Feature
**Date:** 2026-02-04

### Content

**Promotions System — Sticky Banner + Dedicated Page**

A site-wide promotions system was added to the rentals section.

**Components created:**
- `src/components/promo-bar.tsx` — Sticky top banner (emerald, 44px height). Fixed position, z-50. Shows current active promotion message + CTA button linking to /rentals/promos. Dismissible via X button; dismissal persists in sessionStorage (`dc-promo-bar-dismissed`). Sets CSS custom property `--promo-bar-height` on `<html>` so Header can shift down dynamically.
- `src/app/rentals/layout.tsx` — Layout wrapper that renders `<PromoBar />` above all rental sub-pages (landing, room details, compare, promos, etc.)
- `src/app/rentals/promos/page.tsx` — Dedicated promotions page. Client Component (`"use client"` required because it passes `onMenuClick` to Header). Reads from `data/promotions.json`. Displays active promo card(s) and shows inactive promos as greyed out.

**Data source:**
- `data/promotions.json` — Single source of truth for all promotions. Structure:
  - `bannerPromo`: `{ message, cta, link }` — controls the sticky banner text
  - `activePromotions[]`: Array of promo objects with `{ id, title, discount, code, description, validFrom, validTo, active, type, targetAudience, conditions }`
  - `inactivePromotions[]`: Same structure, shown as archived on promos page

**Header integration:**
- `src/components/header.tsx` uses `style={{ top: "var(--promo-bar-height, 0px)" }}` instead of hardcoded `top-0` so it shifts below the promo bar when visible

**Bug fixed during implementation:**
- promos/page.tsx initially had no `"use client"` directive. Passing `onMenuClick={() => {}}` to Header (a Client Component) caused: "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props". Fixed by adding `"use client"` as first line.

### Notes

PromoBar is session-scoped (dismissal resets on new tab/session). Banner text and CTA are driven entirely by `data/promotions.json` — no hardcoding. To change what the banner says, edit `bannerPromo` in that file.

**Studio Cards Made Clickable — Navigate to Room Detail Pages**

The "Choose Your Studio" cards on the rentals landing page (`src/app/rentals/page.tsx`) were converted from expand/collapse toggle buttons to clickable navigation links.

**Before:**
- Cards were `<button>` elements
- Clicking toggled an expanded panel showing additional details inline
- Required `useState` for `expandedStudio` tracking
- Details displayed as plain text separated by `<br/>`

**After:**
- Cards are `<Link>` elements pointing to `/rentals/room/{roomId}`
- Each studio object has a `roomId` field: `room-a`, `room-d`, `room-b`, `room-c`
- Details are always visible as a bulleted list using `Object.entries(studio.details)` with a `DETAIL_LABELS` map for human-readable keys
- "View Details →" link at card bottom has ArrowRight icon with `group-hover:translate-x-1` animation
- Hover effects: emerald border glow, image scale-up, title color shift

**Removed:**
- `useState`, `expandedStudio` state
- `ChevronDown` icon import
- `getWhatsAppForRoom` function (was unused after toggle removal)

**DETAIL_LABELS map** (maps detail object keys to display labels):
```
dimensions → Dimensions
capacity → Capacity
equipment → Equipment
climate → Climate
special → Note
ideal → Ideal for
```

### Notes

This change aligns the landing page cards with the existing room detail pages at `/rentals/room/[id]/`. Users can now browse studios at a glance on the landing page and click through for full details.

### Content

**"Ideal For" Accordion — All Panels Open by Default + SEO Copy Update**

Two changes were made to the "Ideal For" accordion section on the rentals landing page:

**1. All panels open by default**

Radix UI AccordionContent is NOT rendered in the server-side HTML until a panel has been opened at least once. This meant search engine crawlers could not see any of the activity keywords on initial page load.

Fix: Set `defaultValue` to include all 5 panel IDs:
```tsx
defaultValue={["dance", "fitness", "performing", "content", "workshops"]}
```

Subtitle changed from "Click each category to explore supported activities" to "Collapse any category you don't need" — reframes the interaction from discovery to refinement.

**2. Activity copy updated for SEO**

All 5 category panels had their item lists rewritten with SEO-optimised phrasing. Two category titles also changed:
- "Content Creation" → "Content Creation & Media"
- "Workshops & Studio Parties" → "Workshops, Events & Studio Use"

Two corrections were made before deploying the user's copy:
- Kept "dance" in "Private dance lessons & coaching" (original draft had dropped it)
- Kept "Corporate events & gatherings" as a separate line item (draft had merged it into team building)

Closing text updated to: "...a range of movement-based and creative activities" with 📩 emoji on the contact link.

### Notes

All 8 primary SEO target phrases (dance studio rental, private dance studio, studio for events, dance class venue, etc.) are now present in the initial server-rendered HTML. This was verified after implementation by checking page source.

**Pricing Section Rewrite — Range Table Strategy**

The pricing table on the rentals landing page was fundamentally restructured from a single base-rate column to a price range format.

**Decision:** Show price ranges (low–high) instead of single base rates.

**Rationale:**
- Base rates (A=120, D=80, B=60, C=50) feel high compared to competitors when shown alone
- Committed renters consistently pay less than base (see S-2026-02-04-05 for confirmed floors)
- Showing only base rates discourages initial contact; showing only low rates feels misleading
- Range format is honest AND front-loads the attractive number

**Range format (as displayed):**
| Studio | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Studio A | RM 80 – RM 120 /hr |
| Studio D | RM 60 – RM 80 /hr |
| Studio B | RM 50 – RM 60 /hr |
| Studio C | RM 40 – RM 50 /hr |

**Visual treatment:**
- Low end of range: emerald-400, font-semibold (reads first, left-to-right)
- Dash: slate-500
- High end of range: slate-50, font-semibold
- "/hr": slate-500, text-sm

**Language rules enforced (see also S-2026-02-04-05):**
- The word "discount" does not appear anywhere on the page
- No percentage-based pricing language
- No "Who Qualifies" section
- The bottom note "Lower rates are available for long-term bookings..." was also removed after review — it was flagged as redundant (the subtitle already says this) and subtle redundancy creates doubt, not confidence

**Section structure after rewrite:**
1. Heading: "Studio Rates"
2. Subtitle: "Transparent, affordable pricing with flexible rates to suit a wide range of schedules and booking needs."
3. Anchor line: "Studios starting from RM 40/hour" (emerald-400, font-semibold)
4. Range table
5. CTA box: "Request a Quote" headline, subtext: "Tell us which studio you prefer and your schedule — we will provide a personalised, no-obligation quote." WhatsApp button.

### Notes

"Affordable" was flagged as a potential risk word (could feel contradictory next to RM 120). The decision to keep it was made because "Studios starting from RM 40/hour" immediately below backs it up with a concrete number. The anchor line does the credibility work that "affordable" promises.

**Pricing Rules — Confirmed Cut-Off Floors & Website Pricing Constraints**

**Confirmed minimum rates (cannot go lower — these are the best-case scenario):**
| Studio | Cut-Off Floor |
|--------|--------------|
| Studio A | RM 80/hr |
| Studio D | RM 60/hr |
| Studio B | RM 50/hr |
| Studio C | RM 40/hr |

These rates are given to long-term committed renters. Example: Studio A renter paying RM 80/hr on a 52-session commitment, renewed for 3 consecutive years.

**Critical website pricing rules:**
1. **No percentage-based discounts on the website.** The modifiers in `pricing-rules.json` (activity surcharges, time-slot multipliers, duration discounts) are internal business logic — they are NOT displayed to website visitors. Actual rates are negotiated case-by-case when customers make contact.
2. **The word "discount" must not appear** on the rentals landing page. It invites price-shopping behaviour and sets an expectation that the listed rate is inflated.
3. **"Substantial discounts available"** — this phrase has been removed from the website entirely. Do not re-add it.
4. **Rate negotiation happens via contact** — the website's job is to show a credible range and prompt the visitor to reach out. The actual rate discussion happens through WhatsApp/phone/email after contact.

**What pricing-rules.json IS used for:**
- Internal pricing calculator logic (staff-facing)
- `pricing-calculator.ts` utility (not rendered on public pages)
- Future admin/booking tools may surface these rules

**What pricing-rules.json is NOT used for:**
- Any text or number displayed on the public website
- The landing page range table
- The promotions page

### Notes

This entry supersedes the discount-related messaging in S-2026-02-01-07 (which documented "Substantial discounts available" messaging that has since been removed). It also clarifies that pricing-rules.json modifiers are internal only — the website intentionally does not expose the calculation logic.

**⚠️ Outdated entries to flag for integration review:**
- S-2026-01-30-03: States "Starting from RM 50/hour" — the website now shows "Studios starting from RM 40/hour". Update needed.
- S-2026-02-01-07: Documents "Substantial discounts available" messaging and discount qualifying criteria. This language has been removed from the website as of 2026-02-04. Mark as superseded by S-2026-02-04-04 and S-2026-02-04-05.
- `knowledge/master/pricing.md`: States "Discounts are rule-based, not negotiated." This is incorrect — rates ARE negotiated case-by-case upon customer contact. Master file needs updating at next integration review.

**Image Optimization Pipeline — optimize.py**

The project uses a two-stage image pipeline: raw photos → optimized WebP.

**Script:** `media/optimize.py`
**Raw input directory:** `media/raw/{category}/`
**Output directory:** `public/images/{category}/`

**Categories and settings:**
| Category | Max Width | WebP Quality | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| studios | 1920px | 82 | Room/studio photos |
| gallery | 1200px | 80 | Gallery images |
| events | 1440px | 80 | Event/party photos |
| promos | 1200px | 85 | Promo posters (Canva/PostermyWall) |

**Workflow:**
1. Drop raw photos into `media/raw/{category}/`
2. Run: `python3 media/optimize.py`
3. Optimized WebP files appear in `public/images/{category}/`
4. Reference in code as `/images/{category}/{filename}.webp`

**Flags:**
- `--force`: Re-processes all images (ignores cache check)
- Default: Skips images where output is newer than source

**What the optimizer does:**
- Converts to WebP format
- Downsizes if wider than max_width (never upscales)
- Converts RGBA/P/LA to RGB with white background before saving
- Strips EXIF data (automatic with WebP save)
- Reports compression savings per file

**Dependencies:** Pillow (PIL)

### Notes

The `promos` category was added when the promotions system was built. All categories use the same script — adding a new category requires only adding an entry to the `PRESETS` dict in optimize.py and creating the corresponding `media/raw/{category}/` directory.

**Review Feedback Applied — Rentals Landing Page**

The following changes were made to `src/app/rentals/page.tsx` and `data/rooms.json` based on owner review.

**Hero section:**
- Image changed from `01-Studio-A-Main-Floor.webp` (had baked-in "Studio A" watermark) to `Studio A - 1.webp` (clean, no watermark, shows RGB ceiling lighting on — dramatic and vibrant)
- Subtitle changed from "Professional spaces for dance, fitness & creative projects" to "Purpose-built studios with flexible rates to suit different bookings and schedules."

**Pricing table:**
- Table container constrained to `max-w-xl` (576px) and centered — was stretching to full `max-w-6xl` container creating excessive gap between studio name and rate columns on desktop

**Why Choose Us section:**
- Subtitle: "Here's what makes our studios stand out" → "What you'll find at our studios" (less boastful)
- Card "Pricing That Works For You" → "Very Affordable Rates" (more natural for Malaysian audience); body updated from "RM 50/hour with substantial discounts" to "Studios from RM 40/hour, flexible rates for regular and long-term bookings" (aligned with pricing rewrite decision)
- Card "4 Studios to Choose From" → "A Studio for Every Size and Budget"; body now mentions room switching flexibility
- Card "Purpose-Built for Visual Learning" → "Built by Dancers, for Dancers"; body shortened and simplified

**Available Upon Request list:**
- Removed: "Custom room setup assistance"
- "Wireless microphone (Room A)" → "Wireless microphone" (removed room qualifier)
- "Colorful LED Lighting" → "Colorful RGB Party Lighting"

**"Ideal For" accordion:**
- Subtitle: "Collapse any category you don't need" → "These are just some examples — our studios welcome many more activities" (conveys that the listed items are a sample, not an exhaustive list)
- Added "Dance practice parties & studio socials" to Dance & Movement category
- "Dance fitness classes (Zumba, Salsation, cardio dance)" → added "& more" at end

**Room B equipment (data/rooms.json):**
- "Adjustable lighting" → "Controllable lighting" (Room B confirmed to have controllable lighting; this also updates the Compare page which reads from rooms.json)

### Notes

The "Available Upon Request" change removes "Custom room setup assistance" because it was considered too generic and implied extra work. Wireless microphone is not exclusive to Room A — removing the qualifier avoids limiting expectation. RGB Party Lighting is more descriptive and marketable than "LED Lighting."
