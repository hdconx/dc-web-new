### Content

**Activity Constraints (High-Impact Activities Restricted)**

The following activity characteristics require extra scrutiny or are generally avoided:
- High-impact jumping
- Falling / rolling techniques
- Contact-based or aggressive movement
- Activities with uncontrolled momentum toward mirrors

Examples to avoid:
- Martial arts (even "non-contact" forms with falls)
- Combat sports
- Parkour-style training
- Stunt rehearsals involving falls

**Reasoning:**
- Studios feature wall-to-wall high mirrors
- Risk of mirror breakage and injury
- Floor surface optimized for dance & fitness, not impact training

**AI Guidance:** If inquiry includes words like sparring, falls, throws, combat, impact → escalate to manual review or polite redirection.

### Notes

Critical safety information. Should be integrated into usage-rules.md during next review.

**Related Sections:** Marketing, Website Strategy
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Strategic Context

### Content

**Marketing Position — Starting From Zero**

Current reality (as of 2026-01):
- No established social media presence
- No existing customer reviews (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- No customer photos or testimonials to showcase
- No user-generated content (UGC) available
- Previous online presence needs complete rebuild

**Implication for AI/Website:**
- Cannot rely on social proof from past customers
- Cannot use "trusted by X renters" type messaging yet
- Cannot showcase UGC gallery until content is collected
- Must use creative, feature-based marketing instead
- Website must demonstrate professionalism through design and information quality

**Marketing Philosophy — No Competitor Bashing**

Strict rule: Never disparage or negatively compare to competitors.

**Not allowed:**
- "Unlike other studios that..."
- "While competitors charge hidden fees..."
- Naming competitors negatively
- Creating animosity or adversarial positioning

**Preferred approach:**
- Highlight own strengths positively
- Let features speak for themselves
- Focus on what DC offers, not what others lack
- Build relationships, not rivalries

**AI Guidance:** Always use positive framing. Instead of "We don't have hidden fees like others," say "Transparent pricing — the price you see is the price you pay."

**Content Strategy — Building Without Past Customers**

Since UGC and testimonials are not available initially, focus on:

**Website Strategy:**
- Professional, well-designed pages signal credibility
- Comprehensive information reduces uncertainty
- Easy navigation shows competence
- Clear pricing builds trust
- The website itself IS the social proof (shows capable people run this)

**Social Media Strategy:**
- Create original content showcasing the spaces
- Behind-the-scenes of the studios
- "Day in the life" style content
- Feature the rooms, equipment, amenities
- Aspirational content: "Imagine running your class here"

**Trust-Building Without Reviews:**
- Emphasize longevity: "Established 1999" (25+ years)
- Show the physical space extensively
- Offer free viewing visits
- Responsive communication
- Professional website presence

**Future Collection:**
- As customers come, actively request reviews
- Ask permission to feature their content
- Build UGC gallery over time
- This is a growth process, not immediate

**AI Guidance:** When creating content, focus on FEATURES and POSSIBILITIES, not social proof. Show what the space can do, not what others say about it.

**Related Sections:** Classes, Services, Booking
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Business Strategy

### Content

**Class Offerings Strategy — On-Demand Teacher Model**

Philosophy: List classes we CAN deliver, not just what's currently scheduled.

**Current Regular Offerings:**
- Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Bachata
- Jazz, Youth classes, Adult classes
- Private lessons, Choreography

**Can Offer On-Demand (arrange teacher if inquired):**
- K-pop dance classes
- Hip-hop
- Contemporary
- Other dance styles per request

**Previously Offered, Can Offer Again:**
- Yoga classes
- Dance fitness (Zumba, Salsation, etc.)

**Business Logic:**
- We have the space and facilities
- We can arrange qualified teachers
- Better to list capabilities and fulfill on-demand
- Than to restrict listings to currently scheduled classes only

**AI Guidance:** When creating marketing materials or listing services, include K-pop, Hip-hop, Contemporary, Yoga, and Dance Fitness even if not currently scheduled. If inquired, respond: "We can arrange [class type] with qualified instructors. Let's discuss your needs."

### Notes

This demand-driven approach maximizes business opportunities without overpromising. As long as we can deliver (by arranging teachers), it's legitimate to list the service.

### Content

**Studio A — Premium Design Features**

**Important Correction:** Studio A is NOT a basic white-wall studio. It's a professionally designed premium space.

**Actual Features:**
- Purple/dark ceiling with recessed lighting
- Red architectural accent strips
- Green accent strips
- White suspended ceiling panel with red border
- Orange cushioned seating area
- Red curtains
- Polished light wooden floor
- Floor-to-ceiling mirrors
- Professional pendant lighting
- Modern, theatrical aesthetic

**Marketing Implication:**
- This is a HIGH-END facility, not basic practice space
- Design differentiates from competitors
- Premium look justifies premium pricing
- Photos and videos should showcase architectural features
- This is a designed performance space, not converted room

**Competitor Comparison:**
- Most studios: basic mirrors + white walls
- Dance Connexions Studio A: architectural design elements, color scheme, professional aesthetic

**AI Guidance:** When describing Studio A, emphasize "professionally designed", "premium finishes", "architectural features", "theatrical quality space". Don't undersell by calling it "simple" or "basic".

### Notes

**Type:** Technical Tools

### Content

**Video Creation Tools & Strategy**

**Available Tools:**

1. **Google Veo 3.1** (Primary recommendation)
   - Access via: Google Flow / Gemini Advanced (user has subscription)
   - Capability: Generate 8-second videos from uploaded photos
   - Strength: Accurately recreates actual studio appearance
   - Test video created: /mnt/c/users/nvntr/documents/dc-web-new/media/Create_professional_looking_202601301338_cju2.mp4
   - Quality: High-quality, realistic, suitable for professional use

2. **Grok Video Generation** (Alternative)
   - X/Twitter platform
   - Similar capabilities to Veo
   - User testing as backup option

3. **CapCut** (Editing tool - FREE)
   - Recommended for editing multiple Veo clips together
   - Ken Burns effect for static photos
   - Transitions, text overlays, music

**Video Creation Strategy:**

**Multi-Shot Approach:**
- Generate 5-6 different camera angle shots per room (8 sec each)
- Camera movements: dolly in/out, pan left/right, tilt up/down, diagonal sweep, zoom
- Edit together into 30-60 second comprehensive showcase
- More engaging than single static pan

**Prompt Strategy for Veo/Grok:**
- Upload studio photo
- Prompt describes ONLY camera movement (not room details)
- AI extracts room details from photo automatically
- Example: "Slow smooth pan from left to right across the room, steady camera at eye level"

**For Static Photos:**
- Ken Burns effect (slow zoom + pan)
- Multi-photo carousels
- Photo + graphics overlays
- Color grading to modernize look

### Notes

User has successfully tested Veo and achieved good results. This is viable path for creating professional video content without expensive videography equipment or services.

**Website Status — Currently Offline**

**danceconnexions.com Status:**
- Connection refused (not responding)
- Website is NOT currently live
- Domain may exist but no hosting/server active

**Implication:**
- Zero online presence currently (confirms "starting from zero")

**New Website Project:**
- Repository: dc-web-new
- Location: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new

## S-2026-01-31-07

**Related Sections:** Website Development, UX Design
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Design Pattern

### Content

**Button Styling Hierarchy — Website Pattern**

Established consistent button hierarchy for all Dance Connexions website pages:

**PRIMARY Buttons (Solid Emerald):**
- Purpose: Generate leads, bookings, inquiries (direct conversion actions)
- Style: `bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-500 text-white`
- Shadow: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl` for major CTAs
- Examples: "Check Availability", "Inquire About Room", "Get Custom Quote", "Book Now"

**SECONDARY Buttons (Outlined):**
- Purpose: Navigation, information access, supplementary actions
- Style: `border-2 border-slate-600 text-slate-300 hover:border-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-400`
- Variant (emphasized): `border-2 border-emerald-600 text-emerald-400 hover:bg-emerald-600 hover:text-white`
- Examples: "Browse Rooms", "View Gallery", "View Pricing", "Compare", "Open in Maps"

**Rationale:**
- Too many solid green buttons create visual noise and dilute primary CTAs
- Outlined buttons are visible without overwhelming
- Hover states provide clear interaction feedback
- Material UI-inspired design feels modern and professional

**AI Guidance:** When creating new pages or modifying existing ones, maintain this hierarchy. Never use solid green for non-conversion actions. All navigation should use outlined style.

### Notes

Applied across rentals landing page. Should be replicated on all other pages for consistency.

**Google Business Profile Optimization — Complete Guide**

Created comprehensive step-by-step GBP optimization guide at `/docs/GBP_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`.

**Critical Missing Element Identified:**
- Studio rental services are COMPLETELY ABSENT from current GBP
- This is why rentals don't appear in search
- Adding "Event venue" category + rental services is highest priority

**Key Optimizations Documented:**
1. Updated business description (includes classes + rentals)
2. Studio rental services (3 new services to add)
3. Missing dance styles (K-pop, Hip-hop, Contemporary, etc.)
4. Photo upload strategy (15-20 photos with captions)
5. Amenities, parking, payment methods (all currently missing)
6. Communication (Google Messages or WhatsApp link)
7. Social profiles (Instagram, Facebook - create if needed)
8. Secondary categories (Event venue, Dance hall, etc.)
9. First post template
10. Q&A entries (5 ready-to-use)
11. Review collection system

**Implementation Time:**
- Full optimization: 30-45 minutes
- Quick start version: 30 minutes

**Expected Impact:**
- Appear in "studio rental Bandar Sunway" searches
- Appear in "event space rental" searches
- Higher local search ranking
- More WhatsApp inquiries

**AI Guidance:** Guide is copy-paste ready. User can execute independently. AI can answer questions or review profile after optimization.

### Notes

GBP was severely underutilized. Primary business (dance classes) represented, but secondary revenue stream (studio rentals) completely missing from profile.

**Activities Explicitly NOT Suitable for Our Studios**

The following activities should NOT be marketed or accepted due to safety concerns or competitive disadvantages:

Room A positioning enhanced to highlight fashion/modeling capabilities, leveraging RGB lighting and stage platform. These features differentiate Room A as suitable for professional fashion and theatrical events, not just dance.

**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Strategic Change
**Date:** 2026-02-02

### Content

**Pricing Page Strategy - Shift to Customized Quotes Only**

**Decision:** 
Removed percentage-based discount tables from public pricing page. Strategy shifted to personalized pricing upon contact only.

**Rationale:**
1. Discount criteria is complex and scenario-dependent
2. Public transparency makes it difficult to justify different pricing strategies for different customers
3. Different rental types require different considerations (event proximity, setup, customer type, duration, frequency)
4. Better to keep discount criteria internal and provide correct rate upon customer contact

**New Pricing Page Approach:**
- Explains WHY pricing is customized (affordability, flexibility, willingness to discuss needs)
- Shows base rates as reference starting points only
- Emphasizes substantial discounts available
- Encourages contact for personalized quotes
- Lists seasonal promotions and special rates

**All "View Pricing" Links Removed From:**
- Rentals landing page (quick links section & pricing section)
- Rooms listing page
- Room detail pages (replaced with "Studio Gallery")
- Compare page (replaced with single "View All Rooms" button)
- Book page (replaced with "Compare Rooms")

### Notes

Major strategic shift decided during 2026-02-02 gallery/compare/pricing page review. Prioritizes flexibility and relationship-building over rigid published rates.

**Related Sections:** Rooms, Capacity
**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Clarification
**Date:** 2026-02-02

### Content

**Capacity Guidelines - Specific Scenarios Instead of Broad Categories**

**Problem with Previous Approach:**
- Broad terms like "Dance" are too generic
- Ballroom dancing (couples) has different capacity than K-pop (individual dancers)
- Different activities have very different space requirements

**New Approach - Specific Realistic Scenarios:**
- "K-pop / Hip-hop dance classes" (individual dancers, active movement)
- "Ballroom dancing (couples)" - capacity shown as number of couples, not individuals
- "Workshops & training sessions" (seated/semi-active)
- "Yoga / Zumba / Group fitness" (mat-based or structured exercise)
- "Content creation / Video shoots" (crew, equipment, subjects)

**Capacity Display Format:**
- REMOVED: Minimum capacity (not necessary)
- SHOW: Ideal capacity (bold) and maximum capacity (smaller text)
- Example: "25 (max 35)" means 25 ideal, 35 maximum

**Disclaimer Added:**
"These are ballpark guidance figures only. Actual capacity varies based on activity type, setup requirements, and comfort preferences."

### Notes

Shift from generic to specific scenarios provides more realistic guidance for renters. Helps them visualize actual use cases rather than abstract categories.

### Content

**Room "Best For" Lists - Consolidated and Reduced**

**Previous Problem:**
- 22 separate use cases across all rooms
- High redundancy (e.g., "Content creation" vs "Content creation (large scale)" vs "Solo content creation")
- Overlapping categories ("Small group classes" vs "Medium dance classes")
- Too long for compare page

**New Consolidated List (7 main categories):**
1. **Group classes with size ranges**
   - "Large group classes (30-50 people)" - Room A
   - "Medium group classes (10-25 people)" - Room D
   - "Small group classes (6-15 people)" - Room B
   - "Small group classes (2-8 people)" - Room C

2. **Workshops and training events** - Room A, D

3. **Private rehearsals and coaching** - Room B, C, D

4. **Fitness and wellness classes** - Room A, D

5. **Video and content production** - All rooms

6. **Dance rehearsals and performances** - Room A

7. **Fashion shows and runway practice** - Room A only

8. **Theatrical productions** - Room A only

**Removed Redundant Items:**
- "Extension of Room A events" (only applicable to Room B, too specific)
- Separate "Private practice sessions" and "1-on-1 lessons" (consolidated into "Private rehearsals and coaching")
- "Audition preparation" (covered under private coaching)
- Multiple variations of content creation

### Notes

Streamlined from 22 items to ~7-8 core categories. Easier to scan on compare page while maintaining clarity about which rooms suit which activities.

**Room Sorting Order - Alphabetical (A, B, C, D)**

**Decision:** 
Changed from size-based sorting to alphabetical sorting.

**Previous Order (by size):**
- Room A (1,200 sqft) - sortOrder: 1
- Room D (700 sqft) - sortOrder: 2
- Room B (400 sqft) - sortOrder: 3
- Room C (300 sqft) - sortOrder: 4

**New Order (alphabetical):**
- Room A - sortOrder: 1
- Room B - sortOrder: 2
- Room C - sortOrder: 3
- Room D - sortOrder: 4

**Rationale:**
- Alphabetical order is easier to remember and navigate
- Consistent with natural room naming convention
- Trade-off: Room D (2nd largest) now appears last, but simplicity wins

**Applies To:**
- Compare page column order
- Rooms listing page
- Landing page studio cards
- All navigation and room selection interfaces

### Notes

User chose alphabetical over size-based sorting when presented with options. Prioritizes simplicity and memorability over showcasing room hierarchy by size.

**Additional Discount Opportunities and Seasonal Promos**

**Room A Pricing Section Enhanced:**
Added notes beyond the standard discount categories:
- "Plus many other discount opportunities!"
- "Special promos during festive seasons (New Year, etc.). Contact us to discuss your needs!"

**Rationale:**
- Standard discount list (multi-hour, weekly, long-term, students/seniors/members) doesn't capture all scenarios
- Many edge cases and special circumstances warrant discounts
- Seasonal promotions (New Year, CNY, etc.) are planned but not yet defined
- Keeps door open for negotiations without committing to specific percentage discounts

**Reminder for Future:**
New Year promo strategy needs discussion and formal planning.

### Notes

Acknowledges that discount opportunities extend beyond the published list. Maintains flexibility while setting positive expectations for potential renters.
