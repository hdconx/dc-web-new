### Content

**Activity Constraints (High-Impact Activities Restricted)**

The following activity characteristics require extra scrutiny or are generally avoided:
- High-impact jumping
- Falling / rolling techniques
- Contact-based or aggressive movement
- Activities with uncontrolled momentum toward mirrors

Examples to avoid:
- Martial arts (even "non-contact" forms with falls)
- Combat sports
- Parkour-style training
- Stunt rehearsals involving falls

**Reasoning:**
- Studios feature wall-to-wall high mirrors
- Risk of mirror breakage and injury
- Floor surface optimized for dance & fitness, not impact training

**AI Guidance:** If inquiry includes words like sparring, falls, throws, combat, impact → escalate to manual review or polite redirection.

### Notes

Critical safety information. Should be integrated into usage-rules.md during next review.
