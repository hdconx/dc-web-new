### Content

**Activity Constraints (High-Impact Activities Restricted)**

The following activity characteristics require extra scrutiny or are generally avoided:
- High-impact jumping
- Falling / rolling techniques
- Contact-based or aggressive movement
- Activities with uncontrolled momentum toward mirrors

Examples to avoid:
- Martial arts (even "non-contact" forms with falls)
- Combat sports
- Parkour-style training
- Stunt rehearsals involving falls

**Reasoning:**
- Studios feature wall-to-wall high mirrors
- Risk of mirror breakage and injury
- Floor surface optimized for dance & fitness, not impact training

**AI Guidance:** If inquiry includes words like sparring, falls, throws, combat, impact → escalate to manual review or polite redirection.

### Notes

Critical safety information. Should be integrated into usage-rules.md during next review.

**Marketing Position — Starting From Zero**

Current reality (as of 2026-01):
- No established social media presence
- No existing customer reviews (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- No customer photos or testimonials to showcase
- No user-generated content (UGC) available
- Previous online presence needs complete rebuild

**Implication for AI/Website:**
- Cannot rely on social proof from past customers
- Cannot use "trusted by X renters" type messaging yet
- Cannot showcase UGC gallery until content is collected
- Must use creative, feature-based marketing instead
- Website must demonstrate professionalism through design and information quality

**Marketing Philosophy — No Competitor Bashing**

Strict rule: Never disparage or negatively compare to competitors.

**Not allowed:**
- "Unlike other studios that..."
- "While competitors charge hidden fees..."
- Naming competitors negatively
- Creating animosity or adversarial positioning

**Preferred approach:**
- Highlight own strengths positively
- Let features speak for themselves
- Focus on what DC offers, not what others lack
- Build relationships, not rivalries

**AI Guidance:** Always use positive framing. Instead of "We don't have hidden fees like others," say "Transparent pricing — the price you see is the price you pay."

### Content

**Content Strategy — Building Without Past Customers**

Since UGC and testimonials are not available initially, focus on:

**Website Strategy:**
- Professional, well-designed pages signal credibility
- Comprehensive information reduces uncertainty
- Easy navigation shows competence
- Clear pricing builds trust
- The website itself IS the social proof (shows capable people run this)

**Social Media Strategy:**
- Create original content showcasing the spaces
- Behind-the-scenes of the studios
- "Day in the life" style content
- Feature the rooms, equipment, amenities
- Aspirational content: "Imagine running your class here"

**Trust-Building Without Reviews:**
- Emphasize longevity: "Established 1999" (25+ years)
- Show the physical space extensively
- Offer free viewing visits
- Responsive communication
- Professional website presence

**Future Collection:**
- As customers come, actively request reviews
- Ask permission to feature their content
- Build UGC gallery over time
- This is a growth process, not immediate

**AI Guidance:** When creating content, focus on FEATURES and POSSIBILITIES, not social proof. Show what the space can do, not what others say about it.
