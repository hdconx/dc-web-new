### Content

**Activity Constraints (High-Impact Activities Restricted)**

The following activity characteristics require extra scrutiny or are generally avoided:
- High-impact jumping
- Falling / rolling techniques
- Contact-based or aggressive movement
- Activities with uncontrolled momentum toward mirrors

Examples to avoid:
- Martial arts (even "non-contact" forms with falls)
- Combat sports
- Parkour-style training
- Stunt rehearsals involving falls

**Reasoning:**
- Studios feature wall-to-wall high mirrors
- Risk of mirror breakage and injury
- Floor surface optimized for dance & fitness, not impact training

**AI Guidance:** If inquiry includes words like sparring, falls, throws, combat, impact → escalate to manual review or polite redirection.

### Notes

Critical safety information. Should be integrated into usage-rules.md during next review.

**Status:** Confirmed
**Type:** Strategic Context

### Content

**Marketing Position — Starting From Zero**

Current reality (as of 2026-01):
- No established social media presence
- No existing customer reviews (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- No customer photos or testimonials to showcase
- No user-generated content (UGC) available
- Previous online presence needs complete rebuild

**Implication for AI/Website:**
- Cannot rely on social proof from past customers
- Cannot use "trusted by X renters" type messaging yet
- Cannot showcase UGC gallery until content is collected
- Must use creative, feature-based marketing instead
- Website must demonstrate professionalism through design and information quality

**Marketing Philosophy — No Competitor Bashing**

Strict rule: Never disparage or negatively compare to competitors.

**Not allowed:**
- "Unlike other studios that..."
- "While competitors charge hidden fees..."
- Naming competitors negatively
- Creating animosity or adversarial positioning

**Preferred approach:**
- Highlight own strengths positively
- Let features speak for themselves
- Focus on what DC offers, not what others lack
- Build relationships, not rivalries

**AI Guidance:** Always use positive framing. Instead of "We don't have hidden fees like others," say "Transparent pricing — the price you see is the price you pay."

**Status:** Confirmed

### Content

**Content Strategy — Building Without Past Customers**

Since UGC and testimonials are not available initially, focus on:

**Website Strategy:**
- Professional, well-designed pages signal credibility
- Comprehensive information reduces uncertainty
- Easy navigation shows competence
- Clear pricing builds trust
- The website itself IS the social proof (shows capable people run this)

**Social Media Strategy:**
- Create original content showcasing the spaces
- Behind-the-scenes of the studios
- "Day in the life" style content
- Feature the rooms, equipment, amenities
- Aspirational content: "Imagine running your class here"

**Trust-Building Without Reviews:**
- Emphasize longevity: "Established 1999" (25+ years)
- Show the physical space extensively
- Offer free viewing visits
- Responsive communication
- Professional website presence

**Future Collection:**
- As customers come, actively request reviews
- Ask permission to feature their content
- Build UGC gallery over time
- This is a growth process, not immediate

**AI Guidance:** When creating content, focus on FEATURES and POSSIBILITIES, not social proof. Show what the space can do, not what others say about it.

### Content

**Class Offerings Strategy — On-Demand Teacher Model**

Philosophy: List classes we CAN deliver, not just what's currently scheduled.

**Current Regular Offerings:**
- Ballroom, Latin, Salsa, Bachata
- Jazz, Youth classes, Adult classes
- Private lessons, Choreography

**Can Offer On-Demand (arrange teacher if inquired):**
- K-pop dance classes
- Hip-hop
- Contemporary
- Other dance styles per request

**Previously Offered, Can Offer Again:**
- Yoga classes
- Dance fitness (Zumba, Salsation, etc.)

**Business Logic:**
- We have the space and facilities
- We can arrange qualified teachers
- Better to list capabilities and fulfill on-demand
- Than to restrict listings to currently scheduled classes only

**AI Guidance:** When creating marketing materials or listing services, include K-pop, Hip-hop, Contemporary, Yoga, and Dance Fitness even if not currently scheduled. If inquired, respond: "We can arrange [class type] with qualified instructors. Let's discuss your needs."

### Notes

This demand-driven approach maximizes business opportunities without overpromising. As long as we can deliver (by arranging teachers), it's legitimate to list the service.

**Studio A — Premium Design Features**

**Actual Features:**
- Purple/dark ceiling with recessed lighting
- Red architectural accent strips
- Green accent strips
- White suspended ceiling panel with red border
- Orange cushioned seating area
- Red curtains
- Polished light wooden floor
- Floor-to-ceiling mirrors

**Marketing Implication:**
- This is a HIGH-END facility, not basic practice space
- Design differentiates from competitors
- Premium look justifies premium pricing
- Photos and videos should showcase architectural features
- This is a designed performance space, not converted room

**Competitor Comparison:**
- Most studios: basic mirrors + white walls
- Dance Connexions Studio A: architectural design elements, color scheme, professional aesthetic

**AI Guidance:** When describing Studio A, emphasize "professionally designed", "premium finishes", "architectural features", "theatrical quality space". Don't undersell by calling it "simple" or "basic".

### Notes

### Content

**Video Creation Tools & Strategy**

**Available Tools:**

1. **Google Veo 3.1** (Primary recommendation)
   - Access via: Google Flow / Gemini Advanced (user has subscription)
   - Capability: Generate 8-second videos from uploaded photos
   - Strength: Accurately recreates actual studio appearance
   - Test video created: /mnt/c/users/nvntr/documents/dc-web-new/media/Create_professional_looking_202601301338_cju2.mp4
   - Quality: High-quality, realistic, suitable for professional use

2. **Grok Video Generation** (Alternative)
   - X/Twitter platform
   - Similar capabilities to Veo
   - User testing as backup option

3. **CapCut** (Editing tool - FREE)
   - Recommended for editing multiple Veo clips together
   - Ken Burns effect for static photos
   - Transitions, text overlays, music

**Video Creation Strategy:**

**Multi-Shot Approach:**
- Generate 5-6 different camera angle shots per room (8 sec each)
- Camera movements: dolly in/out, pan left/right, tilt up/down, diagonal sweep, zoom
- Edit together into 30-60 second comprehensive showcase
- More engaging than single static pan

**Prompt Strategy for Veo/Grok:**
- Upload studio photo
- Prompt describes ONLY camera movement (not room details)
- AI extracts room details from photo automatically
- Example: "Slow smooth pan from left to right across the room, steady camera at eye level"

**For Static Photos:**
- Ken Burns effect (slow zoom + pan)
- Multi-photo carousels
- Photo + graphics overlays
- Color grading to modernize look

### Notes

User has successfully tested Veo and achieved good results. This is viable path for creating professional video content without expensive videography equipment or services.

**Website Status — Currently Offline**

**danceconnexions.com Status:**
- Connection refused (not responding)
- Website is NOT currently live
- Domain may exist but no hosting/server active

**Implication:**
- Zero online presence currently (confirms "starting from zero")

**New Website Project:**
- Repository: dc-web-new
- Location: C:\Users\nvntr\Documents\dc-web-new
- Status: In development (not deployed)
- Built with: Next.js, React, TypeScript

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete content review and corrections
2. Deploy new website to hosting

4. Launch coordinated with social media setup

### Notes

The absence of a working website explains the complete lack of online visibility. The new website will be the foundation for entire online presence strategy.
