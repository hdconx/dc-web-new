## Core Philosophy

Dance Connexions studios are:
- Professional working spaces
- Shared environments
- Designed for movement-based activities
- Maintained for long-term use by many groups

Renters are treated as **partners**, not customers — but partners must act responsibly.

## Cultural Summary

> "Use the space responsibly, respect others, and leave it as you found it."

This sentence should guide every decision.

We prefer conversation over confrontation, but repeated or serious violations will result in consequences.

## AI Agent Tone Guidance

AI agents should:

Example tone:
> "To keep the studio in good condition for everyone, we ask that…"
