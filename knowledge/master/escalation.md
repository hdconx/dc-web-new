# Exceptions, Special Cases & Escalation Framework

> Source: Master KB Section L
> This is the "judgment layer" of the rental system.

## Core Principle

> Rules are the default. Exceptions are intentional decisions.

Exceptions may be granted when they:
- Do not compromise safety
- Do not damage the premises
- Do not affect other renters
- Do not set harmful precedents

## Exception Categories

All exceptions fall into one of five categories:
1. Time-related exceptions
2. Capacity-related exceptions
3. Use-case exceptions
4. Policy flexibility exceptions
5. Payment & cancellation exceptions

## 1. Time-Related Exceptions

### Early Entry / Late Exit

**Allowed only if:**
- Studio is not booked before/after
- Staff approval is given
- Time extension is logged

**Handling approach:**
- Offer paid extension first
- Grace periods only for trusted repeat renters
- Never assume availability

**AI phrasing:**
> "We may be able to allow extra time depending on availability. Let me check for you."

### Last-Minute Bookings

**Allowed if:**
- Space is available
- Payment can be confirmed immediately
- No staffing conflicts exist

⚠️ Last-minute bookings often increase error risk. Use discretion.

---

## 2. Capacity-Related Exceptions

### Exceeding Recommended Capacity

**Only allowed when:**
- Activity is low-impact
- Movement density remains safe
- Fire safety limits are respected

**Never allowed when:**
- Floor safety is compromised
- Mirrors are at risk
- Emergency exits are blocked

**AI response:**
> "For safety reasons, we can only approve higher numbers for low-movement activities."

---

## 3. Use-Case Exceptions

### Non-Dance Activities

**Allowed selectively if:**
- Movement-based or compatible
- No furniture-heavy setup
- No food or liquids involved

**May be approved:**
- Acting rehearsals
- Yoga or Pilates
- Modeling practice
- Content creation

**Typically declined:**
- Full dining events
- Loud parties
- Non-movement seminars

### Special Event Requests

Requests like birthday dance parties, private celebrations, showcase rehearsals.

**Approved when:**
- Activity remains studio-appropriate
- Sound and time limits respected
- Extra cleanup responsibility acknowledged

---

## 4. Policy Flexibility Exceptions

### Food Exceptions

**Allowed only if:**
- Pre-approved
- Packaged and sealed
- No risk to flooring

**Never allowed:**
- Saucy foods
- Alcohol
- Catering setups

### Equipment Exceptions

**Outside equipment allowed if:**
- Does not damage floors
- Does not require permanent setup
- Is removed after use

**AI phrasing:**
> "As long as the equipment is floor-safe and removable, it's usually fine."

---

## 5. Payment & Cancellation Exceptions

### Deposit Flexibility

**May be considered for:**
- Long-term repeat renters
- Trusted instructors
- Off-peak hours

Not offered to first-time renters by default.

### Emergency Cancellations

**Handled case-by-case:**
- Medical emergencies
- Family emergencies
- Studio-initiated cancellations

**Principle:** Empathy first, policy second — but consistency always.

---

## Escalation Levels

### Level 1 — AI / Frontline Staff
**Handled automatically:**
- Availability questions
- Pricing clarification
- Standard policy explanations
- Booking steps

### Level 2 — Human Review Required
**Escalate when:**
- Exceptions requested
- Policy disputes arise
- Special setups are proposed
- Capacity concerns appear

### Level 3 — Management Decision
**Only for:**
- Repeated violations
- Brand risk scenarios
- Legal concerns
- Refund disputes
- Safety incidents

---

## Conflict De-escalation

When tension arises:
- Stay calm and factual
- Reference policy neutrally
- Offer alternatives when possible
- Avoid blame language

**Recommended phrasing:**
> "I understand your situation. Let's see what options we still have within our guidelines."

---

## Blacklist & Restriction Logic

A renter may be restricted if:
- Repeated rule violations
- Damage without accountability
- Aggressive behavior
- Misrepresentation of use

Restrictions can be:
- Temporary
- Conditional
- Permanent (rare)

All restrictions must be logged internally.

---

## AI Decision Logic

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Affects safety | Decline |
| Affects other renters | Decline |
| Repeat trusted renter + low risk | Consider |
| Unclear | Escalate to human |

---

## Cultural Guardrail

> Being flexible does not mean being inconsistent.

Flexibility must feel fair to:
- Staff
- Renters
- Other users
- The business
