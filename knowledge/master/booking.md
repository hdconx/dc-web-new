## Booking Channels

### Primary Channel
**WhatsApp** is the preferred booking channel.
- Fast clarification
- Structured conversation
- High response rate
- Supports automation

### Secondary Channels
- Email (formal or complex requests)
- Phone (urgent or edge cases)

### Not Allowed
- Walk-ins without prior confirmation
- Social media DMs for booking confirmation

## Booking Lifecycle

Every booking follows this flow:

```
Inquiry → Qualification → Availability Check → Pricing Confirmation
→ Deposit Payment → Booking Confirmation → Usage → Closure
```

No steps skipped.

## Inquiry Requirements

Every inquiry must include:
- Preferred date
- Preferred time
- Room (if known)
- Intended usage
- Number of participants
- First-time or returning renter

If missing → request info before proceeding.

## Qualification Step

Before checking availability, confirm:
- Intended usage is suitable
- Group size within capacity
- No prohibited activities
- User accepts basic rules (no food, no smoking, etc.)

If not suitable, decline politely.

## Availability Rules

- First paid deposit secures the slot
- Verbal confirmation ≠ booking
- Availability is not held without deposit

## Pricing Confirmation

Once availability is confirmed:
- Calculate total price
- Apply valid discounts
- Confirm peak/off-peak status
- Clarify setup/cleanup inclusion
- Send clear total amount, not estimates

## Deposit & Payment

- **50% deposit required** to confirm booking
- Booking is provisional until deposit received
- Admin verifies payment manually
- Screenshot alone ≠ confirmation

## Booking Confirmation

Once deposit is verified, send confirmation containing:
- Date & time
- Room
- Duration
- Total amount
- Deposit received
- Balance due
- Key rules reminder
- Arrival instructions

This message is the soft contract.

## Pre-Session Instructions

Before session (same day or day before), provide:
- Address & access instructions
- Parking info
- Entry rules
- Setup/cleanup reminder
- Contact number for issues

## On-Arrival Process

- Renter arrives at agreed time
- Early arrival counts toward rental time
- Late arrival: rental time does not shift, end time remains fixed

## During Usage

- Respectful oversight
- Noise levels monitored
- Usage within approved purpose
- If renter exceeds time: inform immediately, charge additional hour

## End of Session

Checkout expectations:
- Space returned to original condition
- Trash disposed properly
- Equipment reset
- No damage
- Damage documented with photos if necessary

## Closure & Record Keeping

After session:
- Update booking record
- Mark as completed
- Note issues (if any)
- Tag renter (good / caution / no-repeat)

## Repeat Bookings

### Preferred Renters
Repeat renters with on-time payments, clean usage, and rule compliance may receive:
- Faster approvals
- Priority booking
- Package offers

### Restricted Renters
Renters with repeated overtime, rule violations, or payment issues may require:
- Full advance payment
- Stricter rules
- Declined bookings

## AI Agent Permissions

**AI agents MAY:**
- Ask structured questions
- Explain availability logic
- Quote pricing rules
- Confirm deposit requirements
- Send reminders

**AI agents must NOT:**
- Confirm bookings
- Approve exceptions
- Handle disputes
- Waive rules

→ Escalate to human.

## Golden Rules

- Clarity beats friendliness
- Written confirmation beats verbal promises
- Deposits protect both sides
- Consistency prevents conflict
- Good renters are assets
