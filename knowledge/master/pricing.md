## Core Philosophy

### Transparency First
- All base hourly rates are public
- Discounts are rule-based, not negotiated
- Exceptions require explicit approval

### Time Is the Product
- Rent is charged based on time usage
- Setup, teardown, and cleanup are part of rental time
- Partial hours are billed as full hours

---

## Time Blocks & Billing

### Minimum Booking
- Minimum duration: 1 hour
- Any use of space, even partial, counts as 1 hour

### Included Buffer
Rental time includes:
- Setup
- Preparation
- Cleanup
- No additional free buffer unless explicitly stated

### Overtime
- Exceeding booked time results in automatic additional hourly charge
- Charged at the same hourly rate
- Overtime is rounded up to the next full hour

---

## Peak & Off-Peak Logic

### Peak Hours
- Monday–Friday: 5:00 PM – 9:00 PM
- All day: Weekends & Public Holidays

### Off-Peak Hours
- Monday–Friday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

### Off-Peak Discount
- 10% discount applies to off-peak bookings
- Applies only to hourly base rate
- Cannot be combined with other discounts unless approved

## Multi-Hour Discounts

### Half-Day Package
- Duration: 4 consecutive hours
- Discount: 15% off total hourly rate

### Full-Day Package
- Duration: 8 consecutive hours
