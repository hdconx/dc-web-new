        WEBSITE

The website is where decisions are made. It must:

## 5. Search & AI Discoverability

### 5.1 The New Search Landscape

**Traditional (Still Important):**
```
User → Google Search → Click Result → Visit Website
```

**AI-Powered (Growing Fast):**
```
User → Ask AI (ChatGPT, Google AI, Perplexity) → AI Recommends Directly
```

**Implication:** We must optimize for BOTH traditional SEO and AI discoverability.

### 5.2 Traditional SEO Strategy

#### On-Page SEO
- [ ] Keyword research for rental-related terms
- [ ] Optimized page titles and meta descriptions
- [ ] Header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- [ ] Image alt tags
- [ ] Internal linking structure
- [ ] Mobile-friendly design
- [ ] Fast load times

#### Local SEO
- [ ] Google Business Profile optimization
- [ ] NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone) across all platforms
- [ ] Local keywords ("dance studio rental Petaling Jaya")
- [ ] Location pages/content
- [ ] Local directory listings

#### Content SEO
- [ ] Blog/resource section (future)
- [ ] FAQ pages (answering real questions)
- [ ] Room-specific content
- [ ] Activity-specific pages (dance, fitness, content creation)

### 5.3 AI Discoverability Strategy

**How AI Models Find & Recommend Businesses:**

1. **Crawlable Website Content** — AI reads your pages
2. **Structured Data (Schema)** — Helps AI understand what you offer
3. **Comprehensive Information** — AI prefers complete answers
4. **Third-Party Mentions** — Citations on other sites
5. **Directory Presence** — AI pulls from aggregated sources
6. **Google Business Profile** — Major data source for AI

#### Schema Markup Implementation

Add structured data to help AI understand:

```json
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Dance Connexions",
  "description": "Professional dance studio rental...",
  "address": {...},
  "geo": {...},
  "openingHours": [...],
  "priceRange": "RM 50-120/hour",
  "amenityFeature": [
    "Mirrors", "Sound System", "Air Conditioning", "WiFi"
  ]
}
```

**Schema Types to Implement:**
- LocalBusiness
- Place
- Product (for rooms)
- FAQPage
- OpeningHoursSpecification

#### Content That AI Recommends

Create content that directly answers how people ask AI:

| User Query to AI | Content to Create |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Best dance studio rental in PJ" | Page optimized for this |
| "Affordable rehearsal space Sunway" | Pricing page with location |
| "Studio with mirrors for content creation" | Content creator feature page |
| "Where can I rent space for K-pop practice" | K-pop specific content |

**Key Principle:** Answer questions comprehensively. AI prefers complete, helpful content over keyword-stuffed pages.
