## Done This Session

### Homepage Redesign (structural)
- Header fixed: always visible from page load (was hidden until 100px scroll)
- Identity Grid upgraded: hover overlay per tile — image zooms, vertical title fades, centered content reveals with caption + per-tile WhatsApp prefill button (green, stopPropagation so it opens WhatsApp without navigating)
- Homepage subtitle updated: "Movement for every age. Space for every vision."
- Quick Choice Bar added: sticky, sits under hero grid, two buttons (Find a Class / Rent a Studio)
- Final CTA section: "Ready to take the floor?" with two WhatsApp buttons (classes / studio), prefilled messages
- Getting Started (3 steps) moved to AFTER the CTA — rational content no longer interrupts emotional flow
- FAQs (8 items) accordion now sits after Getting Started, near footer
- Deleted components: beginner-reassurance.tsx, studio-premises.tsx, studio-rentals.tsx, quick-access-strip.tsx (all confirmed unused)

### Homepage Content Section — UNRESOLVED, needs rethink
The section between the Quick Choice Bar and the CTA went through multiple iterations, none satisfactory:
1. Alternating image/text rows → too long, generic, placeholder feel
2. 3 image cards in a row → on mobile stacked identically to identity grid tiles (REJECTED)
3. Pure typography staggered → looked like a "philosophy section" not an experience (REJECTED by ChatGPT critique)
4. Current state: emotional flow with spaced moments + full-bleed image interrupt — owner not satisfied, wants to rethink from scratch

**Owner wants to start the content section from 0 in the next session.**

## Current Homepage Structure (as of this handover)

```
Header (always visible, fixed)
└── Hero: Identity Grid (full viewport)
    └── Studio name + subtitle overlay
    └── 6 tiles: Kids / Teens / Young Adults / Adults / Active Adults / Rentals
    └── Each tile: hover = image zoom + centered info + WhatsApp prefill button
└── Quick Choice Bar (sticky, z-30)
    └── "Find a Class" | "Rent a Studio"
└── [CONTENT SECTION — TO BE REDESIGNED]
    └── Current: emotional text moments + full-bleed image + anchor lines
    └── Status: owner unhappy, full rethink planned
└── Final CTA
    └── "Ready to take the floor?"
    └── Two WhatsApp buttons (classes / studio)
└── Getting Started (3 steps)
└── FAQs accordion (8 items)
└── Footer
```

## Key Decisions Locked In (Do Not Change)

- Identity Grid: non-negotiable, stays as-is
- Header: always visible, nav links correct
- Quick Choice Bar: stays
- Final CTA + Getting Started + FAQs order: stays
- WhatsApp as only conversion goal
- No credentials, no "since 1999", no boasting
- No location-specific copy ("Bandar Sunway", "Malaysian families")
- No real student photos — AI-generated only
- Dark premium aesthetic (black / zinc-950 backgrounds)

## Constraints for Content Section Redesign

Everything the owner said they want to convey (raw, unpolished — needs refining):
1. Dance is not an inborn skill — it can be learned with right instruction
2. Everyone can learn with proper guidance
3. Dance brings wonderful togetherness
4. Dance builds confidence
5. Dance provides a year-round social calendar
6. You'll be surrounded by like-minded people
7. People who celebrate life and want to unwind from daily stress
8. Inclusive — no one should feel "this isn't for me"

**The 7 curated copy lines (Opus-selected, still valid — owner liked these, just not the layout):**

| Theme | Line |
|-------|------|
| Learnable | "Dance is a skill. It's learned, not inherited." |
| Guidance | "Good teaching removes fear. What's left is movement." |
| Confidence | "Confidence isn't performed. It's practiced." |
| Community | "Some come alone. No one feels that way for long." |
| Stress relief | "For an hour, the rest of the day can wait." |
| Social rhythm | "Over time, dance becomes part of your life — not an event." |
| Reassurance | "Everyone here started exactly where you are." |

**ChatGPT's key structural insight (still valid):**
> "You translated the idea into content blocks. We need to translate it into experience flow."
> - No "WHY DANCE" or any label on this section
> - Each line/moment should feel discovered, not presented
> - Emotion needs contrast and pacing, not density
> - Premium brands rarely center everything — use asymmetry and intimacy
> - One image interrupt (no caption, no label) works as a visual pause

**The problem to solve in next session:**
What layout/format — other than text blocks and image grids — creates emotional experience flow for this section? Owner open to completely new approaches.

## Starting Next Session

1. Read this handover
2. Read `src/app/page.tsx` to see current homepage state
3. The primary task: rethink and redesign the content section between Quick Choice Bar and Final CTA
4. The 7 copy lines above are approved — it's the layout/format that needs rethinking, not the words
5. Consult owner on what emotional experience they want — don't jump to implementation until direction agreed
