## Notes: Important Context

**Business Model Clarification:**
- PRIMARY: Dance studio offering classes
- SECONDARY: Studio rental services
- Don't position as "rental-first" business

**Class Strategy:**
- List classes we CAN deliver (even if not currently scheduled)
- On-demand teacher arrangement is legitimate business model
- K-pop, Hip-hop, Contemporary, Yoga, Dance Fitness all valid to list

**Studio A is Premium:**
- Not basic white walls
- Professionally designed with theatrical aesthetic
- Major competitive advantage
- Don't undersell in marketing

**Current Online Presence:**
- Effectively ZERO (website offline, no social media)
- GBP exists but severely underutilized
- Starting from scratch is accurate

**Video Quality:**
- Veo/Grok results vary (some good, some weird)
- Multi-generation approach: Try several times, pick best
- This is normal with AI video generation

**Content Review:**
- User wants to review all pages for accuracy
- Capacity and pricing need corrections
- Tool available at /admin/review

## Questions for User (If any)

Before next session, user should clarify:
1. Do you want to remove "Dance Shop" from GBP? (Unless you actually sell products)
2. Do you have existing Instagram/Facebook accounts to link, or create new ones?
3. Which AI (Veo or Grok) is giving you better video results?
4. Do you want to start with videos or with page content review first?
