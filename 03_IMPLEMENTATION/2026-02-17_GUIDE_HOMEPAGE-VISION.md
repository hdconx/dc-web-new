# Dance Connexions Homepage Vision & Requirements
**Created:** 2026-02-18  
**Owner:** Haan (Dance Studio Owner, Malaysia)  
**Status:** Fresh Start — Previous AI solutions rejected, starting from first principles

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

This is NOT a marketing homepage. This is a **smart demographic router + inclusive welcome** that:
1. Routes visitors to their demographic landing page
2. Makes ALL demographics feel welcome on the main page
3. Prevents alienation (e.g., 70-year-olds shouldn't see K-pop dancers at top)
4. Convinces each demographic to explore deeper by showing their own section exists

**Key Principle:** "This school has classes for people like me."

## HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE

### Top Section: Identity Grid (Demographic Router)
- **6 tiles representing each demographic:**
  - Kids
  - Teens
  - Young Adults

  - Active Adults

Each demographic gets its own section as user scrolls down:

**KIDS Section**
- Imagery: Kids learning, having fun, moving freely
- Messaging: Beginner-friendly, coolness, making friends
- Tone: Approachable, playful but not cartoonish
- Why it matters: Parents see "dance is for kids here"

**TEENS Section**

- Messaging: Coolness, creativity, peer community, self-expression
- Tone: Confident, modern, aspirational
- Why it matters: Teens see their style is represented

**YOUNG ADULTS Section**
- Imagery: Young adults learning, socializing, fitness-focused
- Messaging: Social connection, fitness, learning new skills
- Tone: Energetic, inclusive, growth-oriented

### Generic Sections: Universal Welcome
These sections appear between demographic sections or interspersed:

**WHO WE ARE**
- Studio history/background (but NOT marketing boasting)
- Warm, grounded introduction to the space
- No "since 1999" credentials or flowery language

**OUR PHILOSOPHY / THINKING ABOUT DANCE**

**TESTIMONIALS** (Future)

- Diverse age groups, diverse outcomes (fitness, friendship, confidence, fun)
- Focus on transformation and belonging

**STUDIO PICTURES**
- Professional shots of actual studio space
- Show energy, community, cleanliness, welcoming atmosphere

## CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 1. Inclusion Without Alienation
- Top hero area must represent ALL demographics visually
- If you show only K-pop dancers at top, 70-year-olds bounce immediately
- Identity grid tiles provide "proof" their demographic exists
- Demographic vignettes as they scroll provide "proof" it's for them

### 2. Beginner-Friendly Messaging
- Emphasize: "Dance is learned, not inherited"
- Emphasize: "Everyone here started exactly where you are"
- Emphasize: "Good instruction removes fear"
- Avoid: Elite language, intimidation, "advanced dancers"

### 3. What Matters to Each Demographic
- **Kids:** Coolness, fun, making friends, expressing themselves
- **Teens:** Cool dance styles (K-pop, etc.), peer community, creativity
- **Young Adults:** Fitness, social connection, learning new skills, fun
- **Adults:** Salsa/Bachata options, fitness, stress relief, beginner-friendly
- **Active Adults (50+):** Health, vitality, gentle options, friendship, community
- **Studio Renters:** Professional facilities, flexibility, variety of uses

### 4. Two Business Lines
- Classes (~50% revenue) — routed through demographic pages
- Studio Rentals (~50% revenue) — routed through rental section
- Both equally important; must not prioritize one over the other
- Rental section already built; integrate visually + functionally

### 5. Language & Tone
- **NO marketing jargon** ("Transform your life," "Unlock potential," etc.)
- **USE:** Warm, grounded, authentic language
- **AVOID:** Corporate, sales-y, overpromising
- **REFLECT:** Malaysian multicultural values (community, belonging, family)

### 6. Visual Consistency
- Dark premium aesthetic (black/zinc-950 backgrounds)
- AI-generated imagery only (no real student/staff photos for privacy)
- Asymmetrical spacing (feels discovered, not listed)
- Professional, clean, welcoming
- NOT: childish, overly artistic, cartoonish, feminine-coded, generic

## WHAT THIS HOMEPAGE DOES

### Function 1: Demographic Router
Visitors land → See identity grid → Click their demographic → Go to specific landing page

### Function 2: Inclusion Signal
Visitors land → Scroll through sections → See their demographic represented → Feel welcome → Explore more

### Function 3: Business Converter
Visitors see:
- Clear evidence this studio serves everyone
- Beginner-friendly culture

### Function 4: Studio Overview
Without alienating anyone, visitors get:

## CURRENT STATE (DO NOT FOLLOW)

**IMPORTANT: Ignore everything currently on the live homepage (localhost:3000)**

The current homepage is:
- Terrible
- Meaningless
- Senseless
- Does not serve the requirements

**Do NOT take any inspiration from the existing homepage structure, sections, or layout.**

Previous AI solutions attempted:
- Text block sections (failed: felt generic, flat)
- Dense image grids (failed: looked like portfolios, not welcome)
- Marketing copy sections (failed: too salesy, alienating)
- Unequal visual weight (failed: prioritized one demographic over others)

**Result:** Owner dissatisfied. Starting fresh with THIS vision as north star.

**Start from zero. Do not reference current homepage at all.**

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

✅ All 6 demographics feel visually represented at top  
✅ Scrolling shows specific sections for each demographic  
✅ Generic sections (who we are, philosophy, etc.) work for everyone  
✅ 70-year-olds don't bounce immediately (they see their section)  
✅ Teens don't think it's "boring adult stuff" (they see K-pop/cool styles)  
✅ Parents understand dancing is beginner-friendly (messaging + evidence)  
✅ Studio renters aren't forgotten (equal visual weight to classes)  
✅ Warm, welcoming, authentic tone (not marketing, not corporate)  
✅ Professional, clean design (not childish, not artsy, not cartoonish)  
✅ Easy to navigate to their demographic's landing page

## NEXT STEPS FOR ANY AI DESIGNER/DEVELOPER

**Read this document first.** Everything above is the requirement.

**Do NOT:**
- Propose solutions the previous AIs already tried (and failed)
- Use marketing language or corporate jargon
- Prioritize one demographic over others visually
- Create sections that alienate any age group
- Build generic "fitness landing page" templates

**DO:**
- Understand this is a router + welcome combo, not a marketing page
- Show diversity and inclusion at visual level (not just copy)
- Research websites that serve multiple demographics successfully
- Propose layout/visual hierarchy that avoids alienation
- Test ideas with the 8-70 year old audience in mind
