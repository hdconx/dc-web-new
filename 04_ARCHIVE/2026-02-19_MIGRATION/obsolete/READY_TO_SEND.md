## Key Findings

### Recommended Direction: DARK EDITORIAL
- Keeps existing dark aesthetic (no rebuild needed)
- Premium, distinctive, Malaysian-appropriate
- Asymmetry + whitespace = emotional flow
- Fastest to build (10–15 hours)
- Matches since-1999 positioning

### 4 Alternative Directions Also Documented
- Warm Community (family/community-focused)
- Bold & Energetic (young/fun audience)
- Minimal Luxury (high-risk, high-reward)

### Sections to Build
1. Social Proof Bar (30 min)
2. Studio Showcase — horizontal scroll (1 hour)
3. Dance Styles — pill tags (20 min)
4. Testimonials — marquee animation (1.5 hours)
5. Location — Google Maps (45 min)
6. Getting Started (move existing, 5 min)
7. Final CTA (keep as-is, 0 min)

## Malaysian Market Intelligence Included
✅ Community + belonging language (CHi Fitness example)
