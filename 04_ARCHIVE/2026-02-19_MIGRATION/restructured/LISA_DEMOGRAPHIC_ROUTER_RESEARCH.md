# 🎨 LISA'S RESEARCH: Multi-Demographic Homepage Design
## Dance Connexions Website Redesign — REVISED BRIEF
**Status:** New research mission in progress  
**Date:** February 18, 2026 | 05:38 GMT+8  
**Previous Brief:** ❌ Content section emotional flow  
**NEW Brief:** ✅ Homepage as demographic router + inclusive welcome  

---

## NEW VISION (FROM HAAN_HOMEPAGE_VISION.md)

This is NOT a marketing homepage.  
This is a **smart demographic router + inclusive welcome** that:

1. **Routes visitors** to their demographic landing page
2. **Makes ALL demographics feel welcome** on main page
3. **Prevents alienation** (70-year-olds seeing K-pop → bounce; teens seeing gentle dance → bounce)
4. **Convinces each demographic** that their section exists by showing them

**Key Principle:** "This school has classes for people like me."

## THE PROBLEM (WHAT FAILED BEFORE)

❌ **Text block sections** — Felt generic, flat, not inviting  
❌ **Dense image grids** — Looked like portfolios, not welcome  
❌ **Marketing copy** — Too salesy, alienating  
❌ **Unequal visual weight** — Prioritized one demographic over others

## RESEARCH: MULTI-DEMOGRAPHIC WEBSITES

### Key Insight from Research
Real websites that serve multiple demographics do these things:

**1. Clear Navigation by Demographic (Classes filtered by age)**
- Born 2 Dance: Has separate /adults, /teens, /kids landing pages
- CityDance: Explicit "Locations" + "Class Types" + age ranges listed
- American Dance Institute: "Classes by age group: 2.5-3.5 | 3.5-7 | 8-11 | 11-15 | 15+"
- Fred Astaire: "Students of every age and ability"

**2. No Single Hero Image (Avoids Alienation)**
- Multi-generational community centers show diverse people AT DIFFERENT AGES
- They don't lead with one demographic
- They show "we serve everyone" visually upfront

**3. Explicit "This is for you" Signposting**
- Tempe City Community Center: Filter by keyword, location, category, timing, **age group**
- Brampton Recreation: Step-by-step guides to help non-tech-savvy users
- Honolulu Dance: "We accept students aged 3 years to adult, basic to professional levels"

**4. Genre/Style Diversity in Imagery**
- Born 2 Dance: Hip Hop (young), Salsa (adults), Contemporary (teens/young adults)
- Multiple dance styles visible = multiple age groups visible

**5. Rental Spaces Given EQUAL WEIGHT**
- Community centers show: youth programs, adult programs, fitness, AND event rental all equally
- Not: "classes are main, rentals are secondary"

## PATTERNS: HOW TO AVOID ALIENATION

### Pattern 1: Identity Grid at Top
✅ Shows immediately: "All these demographics exist here"  
✅ Visual proof that someone like you is welcome  
❌ Without it: 70-year-old sees K-pop dancer → bounces  

**Examples found:** Most sites don't do this explicitly, BUT the ones that succeed have:
- Clear navigation labels (Kids | Teens | Adults | Seniors | Rentals)
- Visible from top of page (not buried in menu)

### Pattern 2: Demographic Vignettes While Scrolling
✅ Each demographic gets its own "section of proof"  
✅ Shows someone like you in the space  
❌ Without it: Feels like you're an afterthought

**How Born 2 Dance does it:**
- Shows: Hip Hop for kids (energetic, fun)
- Shows: Salsa for adults (sensual, partnered)
- Shows: K-POP for teens (aspirational, cool)
- = Each person scrolling sees "oh, there's MY thing"

### Pattern 3: Diverse Imagery (Multiple Styles)
✅ Hip Hop (appeals to younger), Salsa (appeals to adults), Ballet (appeals to kids/adults)  
✅ Each style has different-aged people  
❌ If only K-pop shown: alienates older demographics

### Pattern 4: Explicit Beginner Messaging
✅ "Everyone here started exactly where you are"  
✅ "Never too late to learn"  
✅ "Good teaching removes fear"  
❌ "Elite training" or "advanced only" = alienates beginners

### Pattern 5: Rentals Given Visual Weight
✅ Rental section shown as equal to classes (not buried)  
✅ "Professional facilities, flexible rental" messaging  
❌ If rentals seem secondary: loses 50% of potential revenue message

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NO MARKETING JARGON)

### DO ✅
- Warm, grounded, authentic language
- "Classes for people like me" signaling
- Beginner-friendly throughout
- Community, belonging, friendship as themes
- Multiple dance styles (= multiple age appeal)
- Clear visual hierarchy (identity grid → demographic sections)
- Professional, clean design (not childish, not artsy, not corporate)

### DON'T ❌
- "Transform your life," "Unlock potential," "Elite," "Advanced only"
- Single hero image (K-pop dancer) that alienates other demos
- Dense image grids (portfolio style)
- Marketing jargon or sales language
- Prioritize one demographic visually over others
- Treat rentals as secondary

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA (FROM HAAN'S VISION)

✅ All 6 demographics feel visually represented at top  
✅ Scrolling shows specific sections for each demographic  
✅ Generic sections work for everyone  
✅ 70-year-olds don't bounce immediately  
✅ Teens don't think it's "boring adult stuff"  
✅ Parents understand dancing is beginner-friendly  
✅ Studio renters aren't forgotten (equal visual weight)  
✅ Warm, welcoming, authentic tone  
✅ Professional, clean design  
✅ Easy to navigate to their demographic's landing page

## NEXT STEPS FOR LISA

2. → Gather 8-12 real website screenshots
3. → Show Haan the examples
4. → Extract design patterns from his reactions
5. → Propose 3-4 specific design directions
6. → Build in Figma/Framer
