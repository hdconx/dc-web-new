## 🔍 Key Insights from Research

### Finding 1: Multi-Demographic Sites Need Identity Routing
Successful sites (Born 2 Dance, CityDance, American Dance Institute) put demographic routing at the **top** of the page, not buried.
**Solution:** 6-tile identity grid (Kids | Teens | Young Adults | Adults | Active Adults | Rentals)

### Finding 2: Each Demographic Needs Visual Proof
People want to see "someone like me" in the website.
**Solution:** 6 separate demographic sections as you scroll (each with image + specific messaging)

### Finding 3: Warm Colors Build Trust (Especially 50+)
Research shows warm color palettes associated with community + safety (not cold corporate).
**Solution:** Warm charcoal (#1a1512) + amber (#d97706) + sage (#84cc16)

### Finding 4: Rounded Shapes Feel Friendly
Rounded corners (12–16px) signal friendliness vs. sharp corporate angles.
**Solution:** All cards, buttons, images have rounded corners throughout

### Finding 5: Asymmetry Holds Attention
Alternating left-right layout creates visual rhythm (vs. center-aligned grid).
**Solution:** Demographic sections alternate left-right-left-right

### Finding 6: Rentals Need Equal Visual Weight
If rentals appear secondary → rental inquiry volume drops.
**Solution:** Rentals section styled identically to class sections, same prominence
